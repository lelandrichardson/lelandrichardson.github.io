It was a particularly exciting I/O for me, as it was the first time Google has talked publicly about &lt;a href=&quot;http://d.android.com/jetpackcompose&quot;&gt;Jetpack Compose&lt;/a&gt;, the project I was hired to work on in February of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compose is an ambitious multi-team effort to reimagine Android’s UI Toolkit more than 10 years after the Android Platform launched with the original UI Toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t yet watched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsStyq4Lzxo&quot;&gt;session on Declarative UI Patterns&lt;/a&gt;, you should do that now. It is a proper overview of the motivations and goals behind the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compose is &lt;em&gt;extremely early&lt;/em&gt;. It is currently “pre-alpha” (if that’s a thing?), which essentially means that it’s nowhere near done, pretty much everything is subject to change, and we make absolutely no guarantees around API stability. For now, we ask that you &lt;strong&gt;do NOT use Compose in your production apps until we say it is ready&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this is the case, why even open source it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason we decided to open source Compose in such an early state is because in many ways, moving over to it will represent a &lt;strong&gt;paradigm shift in terms of UI development on Android&lt;/strong&gt;, and we wanted to get the community used to the ideas embodied by this new framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, however, that if all of this talk of change overwhelms you or concerns you, &lt;em&gt;don’t worry&lt;/em&gt;. There is &lt;em&gt;no need for you to learn any of this now&lt;/em&gt;, and there is a long time between now and when Compose will be the default way to do Android UI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning on writing several blogs about Compose’s architecture and doing technical deep dives around parts of the architecture that I think are interesting or useful for the community to understand. Writing takes time though, and some of these first articles I want to make sure and get right! In the meantime, there seems to be a lot of interested folks in the Android community that are eager to understand more about this new direction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people have asked me what kind of things they can read or watch to better understand the programming model of Compose in the meantime. Compose has been influenced by many existing frameworks including, but not limited to, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fblitho.com/&quot;&gt;Litho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.dev/&quot;&gt;Flutter&lt;/a&gt;. As many already know, I have a strong background with the React community, so I thought I would put together a list of links to talks or articles from folks in the React community that have really influenced my thinking around these paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these should be helpful to those looking to really understand the programming model of Compose. While Compose is architecturally pretty different from React in terms of implementation, the programming model and mental model are very similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this was the 2nd public talk given about React. The first public talk announcing react was met with a lot of skepticism and public backlash. This talk does a great job describing the thinking behind React, and the problems it solves, at a time where writing UI in the way that you do with React was very new and not well understood. Keep in mind while watching this that it is directed primarily at a “web” crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk goes over some of the thinking behind React’s architecture that has been done specifically to make React scale for large organizations (solving the problems that facebook has). Some interesting points that you might not think of out of the bat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great talk given by Ryan Florence that demonstrates some new ways to think about using React and creating pleasant APIs. Good demonstration and good discussion from a great public speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not super familiar with functional programming, or maybe even you are, but it’s not clear why React is “functional” (it kind of looks like OOP), this is a great talk to explain the “functional” side of react, and why it’s a good thing. The concepts for Compose are somewhat similar, though Compose utilizes functions as Components whereas React’s functions at the time of this talk were stateless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video was the announcement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://redux.js.org/&quot;&gt;redux&lt;/a&gt;, which Dan Abramov made for this talk. It goes into a lot of the thinking behind it and how it was different from flux. He also demonstrates “hot reloading” and some really innovative developer tooling at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was given as an introduction to a recently added feature to React: Hooks. Compose has a concept similar to Hooks which we call Effects, though hooks themselves may end up unifying with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@Composable&lt;/code&gt; functions. More on this later. In any event, the motivations behind them and the patterns they enable are important for React and will be for Compose as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was given immediately after the former, and I think is a good introduction to using Hooks in practice and demonstrating their value. Some of the pain people are feeling here might be React-specific, but it’s worth a watch regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hooks have a bit of a learning curve, requiring you to think of Function Components (and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@Composable&lt;/code&gt; functions in Compose) in a little bit of a different light than traditional functions. Dan, as always, does an excellent job explaining how to think about these things, and in particular, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook, which is analogous to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;onCommit&lt;/code&gt; effect in Compose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent medium-to-deep-dive on React’s architecture, as well as a good overview of how to think different parts of the library working together. Not all of it maps directly to elements of Compose, but generally speaking I think it’s a good primer if you’re interested in learning more about this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I might be a little bit biased here but… this was a talk I gave right as I started working on Compose at Google, and it really is a talk about a project I was working on (building a React-like framework in Kotlin and Swift) before coming to Google. I go over some concepts here that I believe could be useful to those looking to understand Compose a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all I’ve got for now. There’s a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of great material out there, and this is by no means an exhaustive list. These are just a few of the items that have been particularly impactful for me. I hope that some others might find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for some content from me talking about Compose’s architecture directly!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[One Concern, One File]]></title><description><![CDATA[Most of us are aware of the notion of having a “Separation of Concerns”.

It’s one of the holy truths of computer science. An unbreakable law: something we mustn’t ever question, only follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some things about this rule that I think are up to interpretation though. It’s not that I want to break the rule. I just want to explore it a little bit. That’s what this post is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let’s talk about MVC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MVC (Model View Controller) pattern is everywhere these days. I mean &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. Even if something isn’t following a pattern even remotely close to MVC, library authors will try and somehow map elements of their library on to those three letters in hopes that someone might be fooled into thinking it’s as well thought out as the one design pattern to rule them all: MVC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about “separation of concerns”, the MVC pattern is often brought up. In this context, it often means separating things such as “business logic” from other things like “presentation logic”. Hence, the “Model” stays separate from the “View”. The “Controller”, for the most part, determines where the other two come from, and how they interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something that is particularly frustrating to me that comes about when using the MVC design pattern: the number of files I have to create to do &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume for a moment that I am building a web site and need to create a new entity called a “post”. I crack open my editor and create a couple of new files. After a minute or so, my folder structure might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;- Server
- Models
    Post.js
- Views
    Post.ejs
- Controllers
    Post.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: For the sake of example, I’m assuming this is something like a node app with js files on the server, but it doesn’t make any real difference for this post. Most environments will map to the same files, just different extensions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we just created &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; files for our &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; new thing: the Post entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, I don’t have a problem with having a bunch of files in a project… Small, clean, concise, clear files are always a plus. What seems problematic though is that all of these files are &lt;em&gt;deeply&lt;/em&gt; coupled together. If I want to make a change in one, I will likely have to make a change in the others. That leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to MVC we are doing everything right… but we aren’t done implementing our “post” yet…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be generating HTML here, and we don’t want to have a bunch of inline styles so we go ahead and create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Styles/Post.css&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to keep up with the trends and make our “post” fancy and interactive, so of course at some point we are going to plop some JS onto the page; let’s go ahead and create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Scripts/Post.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that our controller code is supposed to be minimal, so we make sure and move that code into a repository and create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Repositories/Post.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just to recap, our project may look a little closer to this now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;- Server
  - Repositories
      Post.js
  - Models
      Post.js
  - Views
      Post.ejs
  - Controllers
      Post.js
- Client
  - Scripts
      Post.js
  - Styles
      Post.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is getting a little crazy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course, this is just one entity/piece (one might say… “concern”) of our project. We will have many more, and chances are each one might have &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; this many files associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let’s make a quick change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider an example where we added on a field to our “post” entity, and need to update our application to display it. What kind of change would we need to make?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Repositories/Post.js&lt;/code&gt; file so that it included the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; property in the data query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Models/Post.js&lt;/code&gt; file so that the model included the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Views/Post.ejs&lt;/code&gt; file so that it actually renders the included image now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Scripts/Post.js&lt;/code&gt; file to have some cool hover effect over the image, because why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Styles/Post.css&lt;/code&gt; file to include some new basic styling for the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa. We just had to update almost every file in our project! The controller, assuming it was properly designed, was the one thing we didn’t really have to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s kind of excessive, isn’t it? I mean, what happened to “separation of concerns”? Was adding our “image” property really such a huge refactor that it required us to change every file in our project?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are we separating by the wrong concerns?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often heard some people remark about how brilliantly the MVC pattern worked for them, and that they had such good separation of concerns that they once had to completely change their underlying data store technology and only had to change one file (or just a few files, or something like that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should optimize the ease with which we can make common everyday feature changes, since that’s what we as developers will be doing every day. It’s not a perfect metric, but the lower we can get to the average number of files needing to be changed by implementing a new feature or tweak, the better off we probably are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about Flux?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem isn’t unique to MVC. For instance, the Flux design pattern that is being pushed a lot in the React community has similar symptoms. In a flux application, I might have a file structures like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;- Server
  - API
      Post.js
- Client
  - Actions
      PostActions.js
  - Stores
      PostStore.js
  - Components
      Post.js
  - Styles
      Post.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, I still have many files across a single entity. Implementing a single feature will often lead to me needing 4-5 different files open… I might add an action, subscribe to it in my store, update my component’s render, add some CSS, and finish it all off with an API call… each in different files. I think on average it may be better than our MVC example, but it’s still not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can we make it better?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s pretend for a moment that you buy into this whole “just one file” idea, or at least you are interested enough that you’ve read this far. Well, what’s the next step then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we stop writing HTML. Let’s write JSX instead. It looks almost identical, but has magical powers that HTML doesn’t have (hint: JavaScript). Components are easily separable into composable containers that are smart instead of dumb (like partial string-based templates are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, this rids us entirely of the need of models and view models. Our models are now all of a sudden just our actual data, and our view models are just our view. There’s no implicit coupling. Logic is just logic, and it’s right there in plain sight. And we have all of the composable powers of JavaScript at our fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result: Our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Scripts/Post.js&lt;/code&gt; file and our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Views/Post.ejs&lt;/code&gt; file have now become one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: CSS in your JS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js&quot;&gt;CSS in JS presentation by Christopher Chedeau&lt;/a&gt; (@vjeaux) at Facebook, you should take some time to look at it. There is a whole set of problems that CSS has that are difficult to scale, and using JavaScript with inline styles solves a lot of them. To get around these failures, we have some conventions like the BEM syntax, but in the end it’s just a bandaid over a huge gaping flesh wound causing severe internal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing our styling into JS actually fixes a lot (if not all) of these issues. And we don’t actually have to change our habits that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the way we do things like now might look kinda like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-code-title remark-code-title&quot;&gt;FooComponent.css&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.foo-component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 10px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; red&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.foo-component-inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 80px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 1px solid #000&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-code-title remark-code-title&quot;&gt;FooComponent.js&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foo-component&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Foo Component
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foo-component-inner&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Inner&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embracing component styling from within JS, we might instead have something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-code-title remark-code-title&quot;&gt;FooComponent.js&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; styles &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  outer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    padding&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    backgroundColor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;red&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  inner&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    border&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;1px solid #000&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;styles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;outer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Foo Component
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;styles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;inner&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Inner&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been a web developer for a long time, you might first see this and cringe—but try to avoid your gut reaction for a minute and look at this objectively. Although there are still valid concerns for bringing all styles into JS-land, this new approach gives us several advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope: We know, with absolute certainty, that these styles aren’t used elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semantically speaking, this actually reads more clearly (ie, it makes more sense for styles to go into a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; property, rather than a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; property).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that we are in JS-land, we can create/mix/compute styles with the full power of javascript behind us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed global&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ve eliminated a file! No mare needing to switch between these two coupled files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Data Retrieval in your View&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the line, the world decided that data retrieval needed to stay as far away from the UI as possible. Let’s play devil’s advocate for a minute and question this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue our post example from above. A dumb, simple &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; component in React might look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-code-title remark-code-title&quot;&gt;PostComponent.js&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; Post &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; post &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h4&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;by &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;author&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h4&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. Nice and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component has some pretty dramatic coupling to our server though. In order for this component to work, we are assuming that a “post” object handed to us from the server is going to have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; property, as well as an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; property which itself will have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those requirements are not explicitly passed on to the server anywhere, so instead the developer must keep these requirements in their head as they are implementing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because “data retrieval” has historically been considered a concern that should be pretty much as far away from the UI as possible, these data contracts are things that we usually and up dealing with &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt; as developers. As a result, whenever we decide that we want to add something to the UI that requires more data, we have to walk all the way down the stack to make sure that every layer along the way has that field properly included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: let your component &lt;em&gt;declare&lt;/em&gt; it’s data requirements, and do the data retrieval itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely what the “Relay” framework that Facebook is planning on open sourcing seems to be addressing. We can actually declare where the data is going to come from in our post component with syntax like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-code-title remark-code-title&quot;&gt;PostComponent.js&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; Post &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; post &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h4&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;by &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;author&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h4&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Relay&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  queries&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; graphql&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`
            Post {
                title,
                body,
                author {
                    name
                }
            }
        `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact syntax here isn’t really as important as the general idea. This allows us to effectively get rid of our “Stores” in Flux, and our Repository + Model in our MVC example, and instead just have our component declare its data needs directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful side effect of this strategy is that our data requirements are now as composable as our components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say our Post component’s render method instead looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; post &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;UserInfo user&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;author&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now don’t know from looking at this file exactly what data is needed in order to display a post, since we are now posting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;post.author&lt;/code&gt; into a child &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;UserInfo /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. If the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;UserInfo&lt;/code&gt; component decides that it needs more than just the author’s name, how will we know? We can actually change the above example to be something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Relay&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  queries&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; graphql&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`
            Post {
                title,
                body,
                author {
                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;UserInfo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;user&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;
                }
            }
        `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect! Now our component’s data requirements are a function of its own explicit needs, and any of the needs that its children components required themselves. No error-prone implicit coupling! If the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;UserInfo&lt;/code&gt; component is updated to require more data, all of the higher order components that depend on it will automatically update their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the CSS example, we see that this approach can have several immediate benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can change the data “contract” for this component and know for sure that it’s only affecting this file, and won’t break any of our other code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since Components are composable, we can also have component’s data contracts simply reference the data contracts of other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can now minimize the amount of data that our server needs to send us on each request, since we know precisely what data the UI needs to display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We brought more files together!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I’d like to mention that bringing in these declarations to client-facing JavaScript files does have some potentially troubling security implications, and those issues will still need to be handled purely server-side… which may not be a trivial task&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I am NOT saying:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear that if our project is made up of 4 entities such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Baz&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Biz&lt;/code&gt;, that &lt;strong&gt;I am NOT saying that the resulting file structure should look like this&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Foo.js
Bar.js
Baz.js
Biz.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I AM saying:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By moving to a component model, we should strive to have our components be completely self-contained and, ideally, made up of a single file. But thinking in terms of components might actually make our project end up with a larger number of files than a project which did not. The goal is to make it such that those files are not implicitly coupled with one another, and implementing a change in one will not usually necessitate updating a chain of other files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By moving in data retrieval and styling into the component itself, we actually start to shed a lot of the weight off of the other parts of the app that were a little bit heavier before. The need for the “M” and the “C” in “MVC” might go away entirely…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like where I think the development world is heading by embracing UI in terms of components, and I would like to encourage you (the reader) to continue thinking along these lines about how we can make developing applications even nicer by minimizing the coupling between files, even if it goes against established “best practices”.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Making React.js and Knockout.js Play Nice]]></title><description><![CDATA[Choosing a JavaScript framework or library to build a project with is a complicated choice, these days.

There’s just so much to choose from. There’s the new hotness, then there’s the old and trusty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve had milk last longer than some JavaScript frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; I Am Devloper (@iamdevloper) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/540481335362875392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 4, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such a rampant ecosystem of choice and change, there often comes a time where you want to refactor your project from using Framework/Library X to use Framework/Library Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I won’t make any points as to whether or not making these changes is good or bad or whatever, but instead I’d like to talk about how to make the transition between two particular frameworks easier: React.js and Knockout.js&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a large project, making the transition all in one big pull request might not be a feasible option. It’s important to allow some sort of middle ground where the two code-bases or technologies can play nice with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do we want?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a transition to be successful, you need two things: 1) You need to be able to use Knockout from within the context of React, and 2) You need to be able to use React from within the context of Knockout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about what this might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using Knockout from within the context of React&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React is built in terms of composable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Components&lt;/code&gt;. Ideally, we could have some jump right into “knockout-land” from inside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; function of a React component. In “knockout-land”, it would be nice if we had access to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.props&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.state&lt;/code&gt; of “react-land”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we want something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; ToDoList &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foreach: props.todos&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text: $data&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With JSX, this might not even be much more than copy-and-paste, and update a few variable names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of complications right off the bat, though. React renders to a virtual representation of the DOM, then diff’s it from the previous version, then updates the actual DOM with what it found to be different. Knockout on the other hand, works with &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; DOM. So we need to actually work with the DOM elements somewhere along the line. We can do this hooking into some lifecycle events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naively, doing something like this get’s us a little bit closer to reality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; ToDoList &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;applyBindings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;state
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getDOMNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foreach: props.todos&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text: $data&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we have a couple of issues. Namely, whenever the props or state update, knockout has no idea it needs to update. Additionally, whenever this component is unmounted, we aren’t cleaning up after ourselves very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tidy up after ourselves, we want to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.cleanNode&lt;/code&gt; function and call it in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/code&gt; lifecycle method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; ToDoList &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;applyBindings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;state
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getDOMNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cleanNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getDOMNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foreach: props.todos&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text: $data&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the trickier part. We could just call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.cleanNode&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.applyBindings&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt; method, but that seems pretty inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knockout actually allows the first parameter of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.applyBindings&lt;/code&gt; to be an observable itself, and will update the DOM accordingly. As a result, it’s best to just create an observable whose value is set to an object with our props and state, and then we can just update the observable with our props and state change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do this in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt; method and then update in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;updateKnockout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;__koTrigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;__koTrigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__koTrigger &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__koModel &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;computed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;__koTrigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// subscribe to changes of this...&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;state
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;applyBindings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__koModel&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getDOMNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;updateKnockout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of what we have done here is really component-specific, so we can easily abstract this out into a mixin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; KnockoutMixin &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;updateKnockout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;__koTrigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;__koTrigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__koTrigger &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__koModel &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;computed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;__koTrigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// subscribe to changes of this...&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;state
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;applyBindings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__koModel&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getDOMNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cleanNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getDOMNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;updateKnockout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could then use this like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; ToDoList &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  mixins&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;KnockoutMixin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foreach: props.todos&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text: $data&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice! Here’s a quick fiddle with a rapidly changing to do list whose state is being managed in React, but is being rendered by knockout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;//jsfiddle.net/lelandrichardson/v2spwr3a/embedded/js,html,result/dark/&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; allowpaymentrequest frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have that direction covered, let’s see what we can do about the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using React from within the context of Knockout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the first part of this post, let’s first try to figure out what kind of API we might want to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React works in terms of “Components”, and Knockout has “binding handlers”, which are a little bit different but not entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/code&gt; component in React-land, which accepts an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; prop. It would be nice if we could render that component inside a div and have it look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;react: Contact, props: { info: info }&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we are going to want to create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; binding handler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;bindingHandlers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;react &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  init&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;el&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; valueAccessor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; allBindings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; Component &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;unwrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;valueAccessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; props &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toJS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;allBindings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;props&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// render to react? initial setup maybe?&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; controlsDescendantBindings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// important&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  update&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;el&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; valueAccessor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; allBindings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; Component &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;unwrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;valueAccessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; props &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toJS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;allBindings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;props&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// tell react to re-render?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple things of note here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we are returning &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{ conrolsDescendantBindings: true }&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; function of the binding handler. This tells knockout to not walk the DOM tree below this node, as this binding handler “has that covered”. This is really important because the DOM tree below us is going to be controlled by React, and we don’t want knockout to mess with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we are not creating a “props” binding, but we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; retrieving the props passed into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-bind&lt;/code&gt; attribute by using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;allBindings.get(&amp;#39;props&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we are using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.unwrap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.toJS&lt;/code&gt; on our passed in Component and props because we want to make sure that what we pass into React-land are plain JS objects, and not knockout observables (under the assumption that we don’t want observables in React-land). Additionally, this “subscribes” this DOM element to the changes of any observable that is passed into, which will cause it to call the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; function of this binding handler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven’t really done anything react-specific yet, but we’ve got most of the boilerplate out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React has a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.render&lt;/code&gt; function which will mount a React tree onto a DOM element that we will want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, React is pretty smart about how this render function works, and if we call it multiple times on the same mounted node, it will simply diff the two virtual DOM representations and update accordingly (making it a very cheap operation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Knockout runs the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; method right after &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; on first pass anyway, so it turns out our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; method doesn’t really have to do anything. In the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; method, in order to render to react we simply need to call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; el&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it! With all that, we end up with a binding handler something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;bindingHandlers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;react &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  init&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; controlsDescendantBindings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// important&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  update&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;el&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; valueAccessor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; allBindings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; Component &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;unwrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;valueAccessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; props &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toJS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;allBindings&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;props&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// tell react to render/re-render&lt;/span&gt;
    React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; el&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crazy simple, right? I don’t know if I should be more impressed with Knockout or React, but it sure was easy to get these two playing together nicely going this direction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a fiddle that is doing basically the same thing as the fiddle above, but the todo items are being held in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt; in knockout-land, but being rendered by React.js!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;//jsfiddle.net/lelandrichardson/vu9vq2u0/embedded/js,html,result/dark/&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; allowpaymentrequest frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Using some of Knockout 3.0’s new features, it is probably possible to make this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;react: Contact, props: { info: model().info }&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;look a little more like this instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Contact info&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;model().info&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’m skeptical that this adds any value over what we have now. Would be a fun to get working though…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some parting thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear to people that I’m not trying to promote the usage of knockout and react together as a good practice. I think that if you are wanting to migrate a project from one to the other, this is a good way to do it “piece-meal”. That is all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I haven’t given much thought to the performance of these implementations. I think if you are worried about the performance here it might be worth it for you to just spend the extra time to port the project into whatever library you want to end up in, however, if anyone wants to run some performance tests on the code above, or has any thoughts on how to make the implementation better, please let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Custom Lucene Tokenizer for Tech Keywords]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the world of search and text indexing, Lucene is perhaps the most pervasive implementation.

These days many developers opt to use technology that uses Lucene’s inverted index implementation under-the-hood, like Elastic Search, Solr, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexing text is hard. Lucene will get you most of the way, but massive search engines like Google have spoiled most of the public into expecting search to “just work”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Tech.pro, we use Lucene.Net to power our search, and it works pretty well, but there are some issues. One issue in particular that I’d like to talk about today is tokenizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucene has some built in tokenizers that work pretty well for most scenarios. Tokenizers are meant to take in an arbitrary piece of text content, and then normalize it into a stream of “tokens” which can then be compared to one another, where equality would mean that they “meant” the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems fairly simple, and it can be, but it can also get quite complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, consider the simple situation of plural word forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cat was cleaning its fur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;versus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cats were cleaning their fur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, if we made the search &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat fur&lt;/code&gt;, depending on your tokenizer, only the first example, with the non-plural “cat” would show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucene comes with several tokenizers to abstract out some of this complexity for common use cases. In Tech.pro’s case, we used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;StandardAnalyzer&lt;/code&gt;, which is intended for text in the english language, and normalizes based on a couple of factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing the standard analyzer does is remove punctuation and non-word characters. This is normally desirable, but on Tech.pro we talk a lot about technologies, some of which have punctuation in their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the scenario where someone wants to search for articles on C#. They might search for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C# tutorial&lt;/code&gt;, which lucene would then tokenize into the two tokens: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c tutorial&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C#&lt;/code&gt; gets tokenized into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is already a meaningful think in tech (a programming language), not to mention that there is also &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; (another language) which also gets normalized into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had been a known problem in our search since day one, so we decided to investigate to see what could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a custom Tokenizer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel, so from the get-go I tried to figure out what classes Lucene already exposes that we could override for our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CharTokenizer&lt;/code&gt; was one such class. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CharTokenizer&lt;/code&gt; is a very basic implementation of a tokenizer which simply looks character-to-character to determine if a character is or isn’t part of a token, and then streams contiguous token characters together into a single token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works great if determining whether or not a character is part of a token is only a function of the character itself. This isn’t the scenario we are in, but it is a useful first step. I created a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TechKeywordTokenizer&lt;/code&gt; that simply includes all letters, digits, and the characters &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; into the set of valid token characters. After some looking around, this seems to be inclusive of most of the tech keywards that I wanted to differentiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TechKeywordTokenizer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;CharTokenizer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Normalize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ToLower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;IsTokenChar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// we are splitting tokens on non-letters, so long&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// as they are not &quot;+&quot; or &quot;#&quot;, which are often used in tech&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// key words (like C++ and C#)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;IsLetterOrDigit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;+&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping here would clearly be problematic, as now we’ve just lobbed a huge curve-ball into our indexing process. At this point, if a word was at the end of a sentence, it would tokenize differently than if it was in the middle of a sentence. For instance, with the two sets of text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was fun and scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the latter would show up for a search for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we need to create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TokenFilter&lt;/code&gt; to take in the tokens from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TechKeywordTokenizer&lt;/code&gt;, and let the good ones through, and fix the bad ones (like periods at the end of a sentence).&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;newTerm &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of code for something pretty simple. The important stuff is all in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Normalize&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Normalize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; term&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    term &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; term&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;TrimStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;+&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    term &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; term&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;TrimEnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;term&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; term&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, our tokenizer has left some special characters like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; on our tokens, but we are removing them again in some cases. Namely, we are removing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; from the start of terms, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; from the end of terms. (that’s it!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building our Analyzer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now want to build an analyzer that does the full tokenization of our text. This is simply putting together the classes we have just built, and the built-in tokenizers/filters that we want to use on top of our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case we want to also add the english &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;StopFilter&lt;/code&gt; to our overall analysis. To do this, we create a new analyzer and implement the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TokenStream&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TechKeywordAnalyzer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Analyzer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TokenStream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;TokenStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; fieldName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TextReader&lt;/span&gt; reader&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TokenStream&lt;/span&gt; result &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TechKeywordTokenizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;reader&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        result &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TechKeywordTokenFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        result &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;StopFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; StopAnalyzer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that’s it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Have anything to add?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of searching to see how others have tackled problems like this, and wound up with very little. If you’ve implemented similar things for similar problems, or have anything you think we should add to this implementation, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clever way to "demethodize" Native JS Methods]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently I wrote a blog:  Functional JavaScript, Part 3: .apply(), .call(), and the arguments object Taylor Smith ended up making a comment…]]></description><link>intelligiblebabble.com/clever-way-to-demethodize-native-js-methods/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">intelligiblebabble.com/clever-way-to-demethodize-native-js-methods/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently I wrote a blog: &lt;a href=&quot;/functional-javascript-part-3-apply-call-and-the-arguments-object/&quot;&gt;Functional JavaScript, Part 3: .apply(), .call(), and the arguments object&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor Smith ended up making a comment about a piece of code from my tutorial that could be simplified (or shortened, at least):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can simplify this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; args &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;slice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Function&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Function&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;call&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite the clever piece of code. And today Louis Lazaris asked for someone to explain it in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original function that I wrote, is a function that accepts a single function as an argument. In return, it gives back a new function which is like the old one, except the arguments are “shifted” to the right by one, and the first argument is now what the old function used to expect as the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; context variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an example, let’s use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;String.prototype.split&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; test &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;abc,def,g&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
test&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;def&quot;,&quot;g&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; split &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;String&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;test&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;def&quot;,&quot;g&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both my version and taylor’s version produce the same results, but why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at all of the moving parts. Taylor’s function makes use of two prototype methods: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.bind&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.call&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function signatures for these methods look kinda like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;Function&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;thisArg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

Function&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;thisArg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So firstly, we are calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.bind&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;. Since &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.bind&lt;/code&gt; is a function, it has itself as one of it’s prototype methods. Kind of crazy, I know… but what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that whatever we pass into the second &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.bind&lt;/code&gt;, is going to become the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;thisArg&lt;/code&gt; in the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we could sort of decompose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Function&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;bind&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Function&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;call&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is the same as…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; Function&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;call&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this is really the clever part. When you run .bind on Function.call, it’s similar to shifting the arguments by 1…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is the same as…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;thisArg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;thisArg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is written using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; notation of ECMAScript 6, since it makes it easier to understand. In reality, this last block of code is the same as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; args &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;slice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which you can see is pretty close to my original function.&lt;/p&gt;

Currying is absolutely essential to Functional Programming, and in this post we are going to take a deep dive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is currying?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes just a single argument and returns another function if any arguments are still needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When said like this, I think currying sounds rather simple. What would this look like in JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we want to write a function that takes 3 arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;sendMsg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; to&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sincerely,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;- &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment, let’s assume we have some function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt;, which turns any old JavaScript function into a curried function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; sendMsgCurried &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sendMsg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// returns function(a,b,c)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; sendMsgFromJohnToBob &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sendMsgCurried&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;John&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Bob&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// returns function(c)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sendMsgFromJohnToBob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Come join the curry party!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; &quot;Hello Bob, Come join the curry party! Sincerely, - John&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manual Currying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we had some mystical &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; function. I will get to the implementation of such a function, but in the mean time, we should first see why such a function would be needed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, currying a function manually is not difficult, but it sure is verbose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// uncurried&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;example1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// do something with a, b, and c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// curried&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;example2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// do something with a, b, and c&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, if you don’t specify all of the arguments of a function, it will be invoked anyway. This is a neat feature of JavaScript, but it makes currying difficult and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is every function is a function of one parameter. If you want to have more parameters, you then must define nested functions. Yuck! Doing this once or twice is fine, but this is quite verbose and hard to read if we want to do this a lot. (Don’t worry though, I’ll show you a way around it in a second!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some functional programming languages, such as Haskell and OCaml, have function currying baked into the language’s syntax. In these languages, for example, &lt;strong&gt;every function is a function of one argument, and one argument only&lt;/strong&gt;. You may think that such a restriction would be more annoying than helpful, but the language’s syntax is such that this restriction is virtually unnoticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in OCaml, one could define the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;example&lt;/code&gt; function like the example above in two possible ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; example1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; a b c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;(* do something with a, b, c *)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; example2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; b &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;(* do something with a, b, c *)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty easy to see how these two examples look analogous to the two JavaScript examples above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference, however, is that in OCaml &lt;strong&gt;these are &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same thing&lt;/strong&gt;. In OCaml, no functions have multiple arguments. However, declaring multiple arguments in a row is “short-hand” for defining nested one-argument functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, invoking curried functions syntactically looks the same in OCaml as what one would expect invoking a function with multiple arguments would be. To call the functions above we would write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;example1 foo bar baz
example2 foo bar baz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas in JavaScript, we have the obvious difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;example1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;foo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; bar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; baz&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;example2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;foo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;bar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;baz&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in languages such as OCaml, currying is baked into the language. In JavaScript, currying is possible (higher-order functions), but the syntax is inconvenient. This is why we decide to make a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; function which does the heavy lifting for us, and keeps our code succinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; helper function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally we would like to have an easy way to transform a plain-old JavaScript function (of multiple parameters) into a fully curried function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is not my own, and has been done by others, for example the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.autoCurry()&lt;/code&gt; function in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fitzgen.github.io/wu.js/#wu-autocurry&quot;&gt;wu.js library&lt;/a&gt; (though the implementation you are about to see is my own).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s create a simple helper function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sub_curry&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sub_curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/*, variable number of args */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; args &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;slice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s think for a minute about what this does. It’s pretty simple. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sub_curry&lt;/code&gt; accepts a function as it’s first argument, and any number of arguments following that. It then returns a function which, when applied, will take the arguments originally passed in, plus the arguments passed in when it’s invoked, and call the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// these are all equivalent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sub_curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sub_curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sub_curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this isn’t quite what we want, but it is starting to look a little like currying. Now we are ready to define the following &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// capture fn&apos;s # of parameters&lt;/span&gt;
  length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// not all arguments have been specified. Curry once more.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; combined &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sub_curry&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; combined&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; sub_curry&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; combined&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// all arguments have been specified, actually call function&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function accepts two arguments, a function and a number of arguments to “curry”. The second argument is optional, and if omitted, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.length&lt;/code&gt; property is used, which tells you the number of arguments the function was defined with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we can demonstrate the following behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; fn &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// these are all equivalent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait… WHAT?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your mind blown? It should be! We can now make functions in JavaScript curried and behave just like functions in OCaml or Haskell. Even more, if we want to pass multiple arguments in at once, we can just separate the arguments with a comma like we did before. No need to have all those ugly parentheses between arguments, even when it is curried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is incredibly useful, and I’m gonna talk about why in a second, but first I am going to take this &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; function &lt;em&gt;just one step further&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currying with “holes”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So currying functions is great, but it causes you to put a little more thought into what the order of arguments should be for functions you define. After all, the idea behind currying is to create new functions, with more specific functionality, out of other more general functions by partially applying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course that only works if the left-most argument is the argument you want to partially apply!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remedy this, in some functional programming languages there is a special “placeholder variable” defined. It is usually assigned to the underscore &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; such that if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; is passed in as a function argument, it is as if it was “skipped”. and is still yet to be specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is useful when you would like to partially apply a certain function, but the argument you would like to partially apply is not the left-most argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we might have the function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;sendAjax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;url&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; options&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we might want to define a new function which partially applies sendAjax with specific &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt;, but allows &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; to be specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we could do this pretty simply by defining the function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;sendPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;url&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sendAjax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;url&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; type&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;POST&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; contentType&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;application/json&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR, using this underscore convention, what if we could just do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; sendPost &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sendAjax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;_&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; _&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  type&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;POST&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  contentType&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;application/json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the two parameters passed in with the underscore. Obviously, this isn’t functionality that JavaScript has natively, so how would we go about doing this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back and see if we can make our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; function a little bit smarter…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we define a global reference to our “placeholder” variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; _ &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make it an object literal &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; so that we can test for reference-equality via the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; operator later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could really call this whatever you’d like, but let’s keep it as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; for simplicity. We can now define our new &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; function as something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  args &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; args &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  holes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; holes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; _args &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      _holes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      argStart &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; _args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      holeStart &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; _holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      arg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      arg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; _ &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; holeStart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        holeStart&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        _holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;_holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// move hole from beginning to end&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; _&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;holeStart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        holeStart&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        _args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;_holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; arg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// insert arg at index of hole&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        _args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;_args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; curry&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; _args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; _holes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; _args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curry function behaves almost identically to the last one, but the actual code is quite a bit different. We are now doing a bit of record keeping on where these “hole” arguments are. All in all, though, the principals of what is going on are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate our new helper, the following statements are all equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; f &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crazy, right?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do I care? How is currying useful to me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be sitting here thinking…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems cool and all… but is this really going to &lt;strong&gt;help me write better code?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of reasons why function currying is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Function currying allows and encourages you to compartmentalize complex functionality into smaller and easier to reason about parts. These smaller units of logic are dramatically easier to understand and test, and then your application becomes a nice and clean composition of the smaller parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give a simple example, let’s compare writing a naive CSV parser in Vanilla.js, Underscore.js, and “the functional way” (with full-on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these examples are equivalent in functionality. I’ve intentionally written them to be as similar as I could possibly make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to be anything but subjective with examples such as this, but I really do think the last example, the “functional” way, shows some of the power behind functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some notes on the performance of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the performance-minded folks out there might take a look at some of this and feel like their face is melting. I mean, look at all of this extra stuff going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, yes, using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; all over the place has some amount of overhead. Depending on what you are doing, this may or may not impact you in a noticeable way. That being said, I would venture to say that in &lt;em&gt;almost all&lt;/em&gt; cases, your code will have performance bottlenecks in other areas before this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to performance, here are some overall things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; object is generally much slower than accessing named arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some older browsers have a very slow implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments.length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fn.apply( ... )&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fn.call( ... )&lt;/code&gt; in general is marginally slower than invoking directly like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fn( ... )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating lots of nested scopes and closures comes at a cost, both in memory and speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most web applications the “bottle-neck” is going to be DOM interaction. It is very unlikely that you will notice a performance hit at all. Obviously, use the above code at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Up Next:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot more to talk about regarding functional programming in JavaScript. Coming up in the series will be discussions on Variadic Functions, Functors, Monads, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I’ve been asked to provide more in-depth examples of functional programming, and to do so I will be implementing the viral &lt;a href=&quot;http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/&quot;&gt;puzzle-game 2048&lt;/a&gt;, and an AI Solver all from scratch! Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

In order to do that, understanding function invocation and the Function prototype in detail is very much a pre-requisite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;third post&lt;/strong&gt; of a (to be determined)-post series on Functional Programming in Javascript. If you are just joining in, you may want to jump back to previous posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/functional-javascript-part-2-what-makes-a-language-functional&quot;&gt;Part 2: What makes a language “functional”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve successfully read or ignored the above links, we are ready to move on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt; prototype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we crack open our favorite browser + JavaScript console, let’s take a look at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype&lt;/code&gt; object’s properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;Object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getOwnPropertyNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Function&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;length&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;, &quot;caller&quot;, &quot;constructor&quot;, &quot;bind&quot;, &quot;toString&quot;, &quot;call&quot;, &quot;apply&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output here might vary depending on the browser and version of JavaScript you are using. (In my case, I am using Chrome 33).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see several properties that might be of interest to us. For the purposes of this post, I’d like to talk about the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function.prototype.length&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function.prototype.call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function.prototype.apply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is a property, while the other two are methods. In addition to these, I’d also like to discuss the special variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;em&gt;slightly different&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.arguments&lt;/code&gt; (now &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/arguments&quot;&gt;deprecated&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, I am going to define a “tester” function which will help us understand what is going on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;tester&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; c
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function simply logs the value of the parameters passed into it, along with the value of it’s “context variable”, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s try a couple of things out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tester&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; {this: Window, a: &quot;a&quot;, b: (undefined), c: (undefined)}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tester&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;this&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;is&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;cool&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; {this: Window, a: &quot;this&quot;, b: &quot;is&quot;, c: &quot;cool&quot;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We notice that if the second and third parameters are left blank, they show up as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. Additionally, we notice that the default “context” of a function is the global &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.call&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.call&lt;/code&gt; method of a function invokes the function with the context variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; set to the first argument passed in, and then each additional argument is passed into the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;thisArg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; arg1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; arg2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the following two lines are effectively equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tester&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;this&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;is&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;cool&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
tester&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;this&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;is&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;cool&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we can pass whatever we want in though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;tester&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;this?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;is&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;even&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;cooler&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; {this: &quot;this?&quot;, a: &quot;is&quot;, b: &quot;even&quot;, c: &quot;cooler&quot;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main utility of this method is to set the value of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; in the function you are calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.apply&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.apply&lt;/code&gt; method of a function has a bit more utility than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.call&lt;/code&gt;. Similar to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.call&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.apply&lt;/code&gt; invokes the function with the context variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; set to the first argument passed in. The second and final argument, however, will end up being the arguments of the function provided as an array (or an array-like object);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;fun&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;thisArg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;argsArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the folllowing three lines are all equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tester&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;this&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;is&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;cool&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
tester&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;this&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;is&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;cool&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
tester&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;this&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;is&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;cool&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to specify the arguments list as an array is often times very useful (as we will find out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Math.max&lt;/code&gt; function is a variadic function (a funciton which expects any number of arguments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;

Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if I have an array of numbers and I need to find the maximum with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Math.max&lt;/code&gt; function, how do I go about doing that in one line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; numbers &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;max&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; numbers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.apply&lt;/code&gt; method really starts to show it’s importance when coupled with the special &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; object&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every function expression has a special local variable accessible inside it’s scope: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt;. To investigate it’s properties, let’s create another tester function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;tester&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getOwnPropertyNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: We must use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Object.getOwnPropertyNames&lt;/code&gt; in situations like this, because &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; has some properties that are not marked as enumerable, so they will not show up if we just do something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;console.log(arguments)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we test by invoking the tester function a couple of times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tester&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;length&quot;, &quot;callee&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;

tester&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;0&quot;, &quot;length&quot;, &quot;callee&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; variable has properties corresponding to each parameter passed into the function, as well as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.length&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.callee&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.callee&lt;/code&gt; property provides a reference to the function which invoked the current function, but is not fully supported in all browsers. For the moment, we will be ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s redefine our tester function to be a little more informative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;tester&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

tester&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; { this: null, arguments: { 0: &quot;a&quot;, 1: &quot;b&quot;, 2: &quot;c&quot; }, length: 3 }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt;: Object or Array?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; is not quite an array, but it sort of looks like one. In many cases, though, we will want to manipulate it as if it was an array. To turn &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; into an array, this is a nice little shortcut:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;slice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; { 0: &quot;a&quot;, 1: &quot;b&quot;, 2: &quot;c&quot; }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are taking advantage of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice&quot;&gt;Array.prototype.slice method&lt;/a&gt; in order to turn the array-like-object into an array. Because of this, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; object can end up being incredibly useful when in conjunction with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.apply&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Useful Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Log Wrapper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;logWrapper&lt;/code&gt; function in the last post, but it would only work properly for unary functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// old version&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;logWrapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;calling &quot;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&quot; with argument &quot;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with what we know now we can create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;logWrapper&lt;/code&gt; function that works for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// new version&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;logWrapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;calling &quot;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&quot;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By calling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are ensuring that the function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is being invoked with the &lt;em&gt;exact same&lt;/em&gt; context as it would have before. Thus, this logging function is completely unobtrusive if we want to replace some function in our code with the “wrapped” version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Turn native prototype methods into utility functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsers come with lot’s of useful methods right out of the box that we might want to “borrow” and use in our own code. Methods typically operate on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; variable as the “data”. In functional programming, we won’t have the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; variable, but we may want to use the function anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; args &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;slice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// String.prototype&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; split &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;String&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; slice &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;String&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;slice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; indexOfStr &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;String&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;indexOf&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; toLowerCase &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;String&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;toLowerCase&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Array.prototype&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; join &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;join&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; forEach &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;forEach&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; map &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;demethodize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;map&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, many more. To show how these would work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;abc,def&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;def&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;abc,def&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; [&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;def&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//=&gt; &quot;a b c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// =&gt; &quot;a b c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I will show later, it is actually better to use define this demethodize function in such a way that the arguments are flipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of functional programming, you generally want to have the “data” or “input data” argument to be the right-most argument of the function. Methods usually have the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; variable bound to the “data”. For instance, a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;String.prototype&lt;/code&gt; method is usually &lt;em&gt;operating on&lt;/em&gt; the actual string (ie, the “data”). The same goes for Array methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this may not be immediately clear, but it is once you get used to currying and combining functions to get meaningful logic. This is precisely the issue that I brought up in the &lt;a href=&quot;/functional-javascript-part-1-introduction/&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt; post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://underscorejs.org/&quot;&gt;Underscore.js&lt;/a&gt; and will go into more detail about in future posts. Almost every function in the Underscore.js library has the “data” argument as the left-most argument. This ends up leading to very little re-use, and code that is difficult to read and/or reason about. :sadface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manipulate Argument Order&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// shift the parameters of a function by one&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;ignoreFirstArg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; args &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;slice&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; args&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// reverse the order that a function accepts arguments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;reverseArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Function Composition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Function Composition is incredibly important in the world of functional programming. The general idea is to create smaller, testable functions that are “units of logic”, which can then be combined into larger “machines” which do much more complex work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// compose(f1, f2, f3..., fn)(args) == f1(f2(f3(...(fn(args...)))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;compose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* f1, f2, ..., fn */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; fns &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// we need to go in reverse order&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      arguments &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;fns&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// sequence(f1, f2, f3..., fn)(args...) == fn(...(f3(f2(f1(args...)))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;sequence&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* f1, f2, ..., fn */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; arguments&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// we need to go in normal order here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// abs(x) = Sqrt(x^2)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; abs &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;compose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  sqrt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  square
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no magic formula for what makes a language “functional” or not. There seem to be languages that are clearly functional, while there are others that &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; are not, but there is quite a bit of middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some common and important “ingredients” of functional languages (ingredients that JavaScript implements are in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functions are “first-class” objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functions can return functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lexical closures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions are “pure”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe Recursion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NO mutating state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive list, but we’ve at least enumerated the three most important features of JavaScript that give it the power to be used in a “functional” way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at each of these in detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Functions are “first-class” objects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most obvious of all the ingredients, and perhaps the most common among more modern programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript local variables are defined using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; foo &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite easy to define functions as local variables in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are in fact, variables: the variables &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; are references to the function definitions they were set to, and this can be changed at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// capture the old version of the function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; old_even &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; even&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// assign variable `even` to a new, different function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is nothing out of the ordinary. But an important feature of being “first-class”, is being able to pass them into functions as parameters. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;binaryCall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is function that takes in a binary function, and two arguments, and then calls that function with the passed in arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;binaryCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;add&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may seem a bit silly, but when combined with the next “ingredient” of functional programming, we start to see some powerful results…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Functions can return functions (a.k.a, “Higher-order functions”)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things start to get cool. Let’s start off simple though. Functions can end up returning new functions as their result. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;applyFirst&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function takes in a binary function as an argument, plus the first argument to “partially” apply to the function, and then returns a &lt;em&gt;unary&lt;/em&gt; (single-argument) function that when called, will return the result of the original function with the two arguments applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s say we have some function like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mult&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;mult&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now build on the logic of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mult&lt;/code&gt; to construct a new function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; double &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;applyFirst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mult&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;7.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what’s called &lt;em&gt;partial application&lt;/em&gt;, and is used quite often in FP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can also define function similar to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;applyFirst&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;curry2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if we wanted a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; function, we would instead do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; double &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curry2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mult&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying&quot;&gt;“function currying”&lt;/a&gt;. It’s similar to partial application, but can be a bit more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discuss &lt;a href=&quot;/functional-javascript-part-4-function-currying/&quot;&gt;much more about currying&lt;/a&gt; later in this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely where much of the power of functional programming comes from. Simple and understandable functions become the building blocks of our software. Functions can be combined and mixed together to form more complex behavior while having a high level of organization and very little re-use of logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher order functions can get a bit more fun. Let’s look at a couple more examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flip the order of arguments for a binary function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// flip the argument order of a function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;divide&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a function composed of other functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// return a function that&apos;s the composition of two functions...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// compose (f, g)(x) -&gt; f(g(x))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;compose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; f2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;f2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// abs(x) = Sqrt(x^2)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; abs &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;compose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  sqrt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  square
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example creates a utility function that we can use if we want log every time a certain function was called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;logWrapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;calling &quot;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&quot; with argument &quot;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;app_init&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;config&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// log the init function if in debug mode&lt;/span&gt;
  app_init &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;logWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;app_init&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// logs to the console if in debug mode&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;app_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lexical Closures + Scoping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe understanding how to effectively utilize closures and scoping is at the core of being a great JavaScript developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… What is closure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, a closure is when an inner function has access to the scope of parent functions, even when the parent function has already returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an example is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;createCounter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;count&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; counter1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;counter1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;counter1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; counter2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;counter2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;counter1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever the function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;createCounter&lt;/code&gt; is called, a new block of memory is allocated for the variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;. Then, a function is returned which &lt;em&gt;holds on to&lt;/em&gt; the reference of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; variable, and increments it every time it is called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that from outside the scope of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;createCounter&lt;/code&gt; function, there is no way for us to manually manipulate the value of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;counter1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;counter2&lt;/code&gt; functions can manipulate their respective copies of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; variable, but only in the very specific way that was intended (incrementing by 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, the boundaries of scope are determined only by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; declarations. Each function, and only each fonction, has it’s own scope table. (Note: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.7#Block_scope_with_let_%28Merge_into_let_Statement%29&quot;&gt;this will change in ECMAScript 6&lt;/a&gt; with the introduction of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some further examples to demonstrate the point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// global scope&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; scope &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;global&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// inner scope 1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; scope &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;inner&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;myscope&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// inner scope 2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; scope&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; myscope&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &quot;inner&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;scope&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &quot;global&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some important things to consider with scoping. For instance, let’s say we want to create a function which accepts a digit (0 through 9) and returns the corresponding English name of that digit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naively, one might:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// global scope...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; names &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;zero&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;four&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;five&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;six&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;seven&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;eight&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;nine&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;digit_name1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;n&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; names&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;n&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this has the disadvantage that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;names&lt;/code&gt; is now in the global scope and can be modified accidentally, which would render the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;digit_name1&lt;/code&gt; function incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one might:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;digit_name2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;n&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; names &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;zero&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;four&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;five&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;six&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;seven&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;eight&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;nine&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; names&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;n&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;names&lt;/code&gt; array locally. This function isn’t in danger of being buggy, but it does come with the performance penalty of defining and re-allocating space for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;names&lt;/code&gt; array each time the function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;digit_name2&lt;/code&gt; is called. If this were some other example where &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;names&lt;/code&gt; was a very large array, and perhaps &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;digit_name2&lt;/code&gt; was being called many times in a loop, the performance impact could be noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &quot;An inner function enjoys that context even after the parent functions have returned.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; digit_name3 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; names &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;zero&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;one&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;two&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;three&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;four&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;five&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;six&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;seven&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;eight&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;nine&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;n&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; names&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;n&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus we arrive on our third option. Here we are utilizing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/&quot;&gt;Immediately-Invoked-Function-Expression&lt;/a&gt; (IIFE), which then instantiates the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;names&lt;/code&gt; variable once, and returns the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;digit_name3&lt;/code&gt; function, which has the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;names&lt;/code&gt; variable in it’s closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution has the benefits of both the first two examples with none of the downsides. Win! This is a common pattern to create “private” state that cannot be modified by the outside environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update Apr 25, 2014: What about what JavaScript DOESN’T have?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve gone over the ingredients JavaScript has, but what about the three things I mentioned that it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions are “pure”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NO mutating state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe Recursion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure functions and NO mutating state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure functions have “no side effects”, which is another way of saying that there is NO mutating state. This makes your code much &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier to reason about, easier to test, easier to parallelize, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you can write code that doesn’t mutate variables, this is not as useful as having the &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; that it won’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe Recursion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you can call a function recursively in JavaScript, interpreters do not compile with tail-recursion optimizations. This means that any recursively defined function can quickly lead to stack overflow errors if you’re not careful. This makes using for/while loops as necessity in some cases (which is decidedly &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; elegant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can it get better? What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is an incredibly flexible language. However, most of the examples in this post may be of limited utility in practical situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry2&lt;/code&gt; function is useful but only applies to binary functions. Most functional programming languages have currying built into the syntax, but JavaScript does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are ways around this: JavaScript exposes useful functions like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.call&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Function.prototype.bind&lt;/code&gt;, and the special &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; object. These functions can be utilized to implement some of the more powerful conventions of functional programming (like currying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will talk about this in much greater detail in my next post of the series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a powerful, but misunderstood language. People like to say that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an object oriented programming language, or that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a functional language. Others like to say that it &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; an object oriented programming language, or that it &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; a functional language. One could say it’s sorta both—and also neither—but let’s set that debate aside for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pretend we are on a mission: a mission to write JavaScript using as many principles from Functional Programming as the language allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of posts is meant to take you on that journey with me. First, we need to clear up some incorrect conceptions about Functional Programming that might currently be in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Functional Programming is (largely) Misunderstood in JS-land&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there is a sizable group of developers that use functional paradigms in JavaScript day in and day out. I would say there is a much &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; group of JavaScript developers that just don’t really understand what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is a result of the fact that most languages used for server-side web development have roots in C, which most would agree is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a functional programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two levels of confusion. The first level of confusion can be demonstrated by the following example of what might be considered common use of jQuery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;.signup&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;event&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#signupModal&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  event&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, look at that. We passed in an anonymous function as an argument, otherwise known in the JavaScript world as the infamous “callback” function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might call this functional programming. Is it? &lt;strong&gt;Not at all!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; demonstrating one key feature of functional languages: functions as parameters. On the other hand, this example &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; goes against almost every other paradigm of functional programming that one can possibly go against in a 3 line example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second level of confusion is a bit more subtle. Reading this, several trendy JS developers are thinking to themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, duh! But I already know all about functional programming. I use Underscore.js in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://underscorejs.org/&quot;&gt;Underscore.js&lt;/a&gt; is a wildly popular JavaScript library used all over the place. For the sake of example, let’s say I have a set of words, and I need the corresponding set of the first two characters of each word. This is pretty straight-forward to do with Underscore.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;firstTwoLetters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;words&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; _&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;words&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;word&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; _&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;word&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See! Look at that JavaScript voodoo. I’m using these fancy functional utility functions like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_.map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_.first&lt;/code&gt;. What do you have to say to THAT, Leland?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although underscore and functions like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_.map&lt;/code&gt; are useful functional paradigms, the way in which these are put together in this example just seem… verbose and hard to comprehend to me. Do we really need all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we start thinking of things just a little bit more “functionally”, perhaps we can take the above example and turn it into this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ... a little bit of magic&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; firstTwoLetters &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, all of the same information is contained in this one line, as in the 5 lines above. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;words&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;word&lt;/code&gt; are just parameters/placeholders. The real meat of the logic is in combining the function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, the function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;, and the constant &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be looking at this example and thinking what this “little bit of magic” is. After all, putting any example with a “a little bit of magic” comment above it is like… kind of cheating, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m gonna spend the next couple of posts explaining that “little bit of magic”, so if you’re at all intrigued, please continue on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of blog posts is here to help others learn how to borrow some of the beauty of functional programming languages in the context of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I will discuss the various elements of the JavaScript language that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; functional, as well as those that aren’t. With this knowledge, we will slowly piece together some of the fundamental building blocks of functional programming, and what they look like in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

This happens every so often and I try to think of a clean way to solve such a problem. Often this doesn’t lead anywhere, but I wanted to briefly share something that did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dictionaries in JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, it is fairly commonplace to treat standard objects as a “hash map” or a dictionary / set of key value pairs. Indeed it could possibly not be simpler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; dict &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// our dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in this case we can set the dictionary entry for “foo” to be 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;dict&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;xyz&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can then retrieve it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; foo &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dict&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty standard. What if we want to get a value, if it’s present, and a default if not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; bar &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dict&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;abc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &quot;abc&quot; is our default value for &quot;bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dictionaries in C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s jump over to C#. Of course, in C#‘s case, we are strictly typed… so we are going to need to declare a typed dictionary like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; dict &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token generic-method&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still pretty simple. So now we want to add an entry… also pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;dict&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// using indexer&lt;/span&gt;
dict&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// using .Add() method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; foo &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dict&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all good and easy. But there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a bit of a difference between this line and the JavaScript equivalent: in this case, we might have just thrown an error!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no entry for “foo” in the dictionary, then this will throw a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;KeyNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In many cases this is exactly what we want. In fact, what is the alternative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, in JavaScript, we have a value &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; to specify these types of situations… the situations where you requested a value that has never been declared. In C#, we just have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, in C#, it is perfectly valid to &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; a value of the dictionary to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. So how does one differentiate between accessing a key of a dictionary which has never been set, and accessing the key of a dictionary whose corresponding value is null?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question, of course, was asked by the creators of the language C# years ago, and the answer was to throw a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;KeyNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; in the case of the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I don’t disagree with their conclusion, I sometimes wish there was a different way. Sometimes I don’t want there to be a difference between a null value and the absense of a key. Without implementing your own dictionary, the best you can do is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; bar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;dict&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;TryGetValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; bar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; bar &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    bar &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;abc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// do something with bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That just seems a bit verbose to me. The alternate syntax would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; bar &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dict&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;abc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is actually quite simple to obtain if you just implement your own “safe” version of Dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;SafeDictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;TKey&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; TValue&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Dictionary&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;TKey&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; TValue&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; TValue &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TKey&lt;/span&gt; key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// adding null value is pointless...&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TKey&lt;/span&gt; key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ContainsKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// nothing to do&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TKey&lt;/span&gt; key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;TryGetValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// setting value null is same as removing it&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant limitation here is that you have to restrict &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TValue&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;where TValue : class&lt;/code&gt;, so as to make it nullable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if anyone else has struggled with this as an issue, but if so, feel free to use the above class!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Better Query Language: BQL Language Specification]]></title><description><![CDATA[For some reason or another, it seems to me that SQL has always taken a back seat in the language economy.

I have used SQL for years, and very little has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working on a couple of relatively large projects which use SQL quite a bit, I have slipped into a bit of a love-hate relationship with SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL has lot’s of beautiful features. SQL is already a fairly high-order language; a tremendous amount of implementation detail is left invisible to the programmer. In terms of spewing data out of a data store, it can be impressively efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But somehow it just still isn’t quite &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most developers I know seem to avoid SQL like the plague… and that’s too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I started thinking about some of the specific hardships I’ve had with maintaining a large SQL codebase, and something dawned on me…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why hasn’t anyone created more convenient languages that transpile into SQL?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is CoffeeScript, Dart, Typescript, etc for JavaScript.&lt;br&gt;
There is LESS and SCSS for CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not something for SQL?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I played the devil’s advocate and said: “What if SQL was a compile target?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so, I found myself wanting a language that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strict superset of SQL.&lt;/strong&gt; This is important because it promotes a clean transition. One can move migrate their SQL codebase incrementally since all valid SQL is also valid in this language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotes good and efficient SQL practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotes keeping SQL code DRY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transpiles into easily readable SQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I will call “BQL” for “A Better Query Language”. I have taken a stab at outlining below a rough specification for what I think would be some positive features to add, while adhering to the constraints above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize what I see as “benificial” to a language such as this, I would put as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Language Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notion of “projections” to keep SQL efficient, and keep code DRY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inner joins are inferred with simplified syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reordered select/from clauses to make autocomplete context more helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;queries can be stored syntactically and referenced in other statements to help readability, logical separation, and DRYness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strict superset, so all SQL is already valid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;syntactic niceties with variable declaration / boolean logic / functions / etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Language Specification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; clause can be anywhere in a statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In TSQL, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; clause of a select statement is done first, which makes it logically difficult to provide meaningful autocomplete suggestions for field names currently available in the context, since that is defined afterwards in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;from&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BQL, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; is valid at both the beginning and the end of the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the following BQL statements are equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; student
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;enrolled&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; grade


&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; grade
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; student
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;enrolled&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;both of which will compile into the following SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    grade
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; student
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;enrolled&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;With the presence of foreign keys, join conditions are implied&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided there is a single foreign key relationship defined unambiguously between two tables, the foreign key relationship is chosen implicitly as the default join condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, let’s say we have the following simplified tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; post &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- primary key&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- primary key&lt;/span&gt;
    postId &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- foreign key to post.id&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following BQL statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; post
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; post p
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt; c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;postId &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When multiple tables are joined in a single statement, the table with which you want to join may become ambiguous, and an optional &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; clause can be added to the join:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we may have the following tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- primary key&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; post &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- primary key&lt;/span&gt;
    authorId &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- foreign key&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- primary key&lt;/span&gt;
    postId &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- foreign key to post.id&lt;/span&gt;
    authorId &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- foreign key to user.id&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then the following BQL statement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; post
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; u1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; post
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; u2 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; post p
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; u1
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;authorId &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt; c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;postId &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; u2
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;authorId &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in some cases there are multiple foreign keys from one table to a single table. In this case, the join condition is ambiguous until you clarify which foreign key relationship you would like to use. As a result, one can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; clause, however, unlike it’s SQL counterpart, only the column in the “foreign” table is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate, provided we have the following tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- primary key&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; message &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- primary key&lt;/span&gt;
    senderId &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- foreign key with user.id&lt;/span&gt;
    recipientid &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- foreign key with user.id&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the following BQL query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; message m
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; s &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; senderId
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; r &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; recipientId
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; message m
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; s &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; m&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;senderId &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; r &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; m&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;recipientId &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; r&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Short-cutting Join Conditions in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joins are commonly used simply to perform a lookup and return the corresponding rows of one table. Provided there is a unique foreign key relationship between two tables, the lookup can be performed by a simple condition in the where clause like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;:country&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Canada&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; u&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; country c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; u&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;country_id
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Canada&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{fk table name}:{pk table name}&lt;/code&gt; syntax is used to identify the join while making the condition more easily legible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Table Projections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table projections are a construct in BQL which is not present in standard SQL. A table projection is simply a named collection of field names which can be used (and thus re-used) in the select clause of any query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, one can define a projection as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;projection &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;contact_info&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; {
    firstName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    lastName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    phoneNumber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    email
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and thus, the BQL query&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; dbo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;users
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;contact_info&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into the following SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    firstName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    lastName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    phoneNumber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    email
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; dbo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, I can mix selecting Projections and field names if needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; dbo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;users
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;contact_info&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    firstname&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    lastName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    phoneNumber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    email
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; dbo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projection can be prefixed by the table name or table alias if you are projecting a specific table in a join…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for instance, provided we have the following projections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;projection abc { a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c }

projection def { d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; f }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this BQL statement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; tblX x
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; tblY y
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;xid
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;abc&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;def&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;f
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; tblX X
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; tblY y
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The special &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;$all&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;$keys&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Projection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every table by default has an “include all” projection. This does not need to be defined anywhere, and is pragmatically equivalent to the ”*” operator in normal SQL, except for the fact that the compiled SQL will have all of the table’s fields enumerated explicitly in the compilation step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given we have the following table definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; abc &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- (primary key)&lt;/span&gt;
    f1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    f2 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    f3 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; def &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    abcId &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- (foreign key to tbl1.id)&lt;/span&gt;
    f4 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    f5 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following projections are implicitly created for these tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- for table &quot;abc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
projection $&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; { id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; f1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; f2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; f3 }
projection $&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt; { id }

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- for table &quot;def&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
projection $&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; { id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; abcId&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; f4&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; f5 }
projection $&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt; { id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; abcId }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and thus, the following BQL statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; abc &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; abc
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; def
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; abc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; def&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;abcId
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; abc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; def&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compile into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    f1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    f2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    f3
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; abc

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    abc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    def&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    def&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;abcId
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; abc
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; def
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; abc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; def&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;abcId&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to select lists, you can also specify computed columns as well as field name aliases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;projection foo {
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; userId&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;{{first}} {{last}}&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; displayName
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the projection takes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; users
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;foo&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and compiles it into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; userId&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos; &apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;last&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; displayName
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projection definitions can also reference other projections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;projection fullName {
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;{{first}} {{last}}&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; fullName
}

projection &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; {
    id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    email&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;fullName&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; users
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    email&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos; &apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;last&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; fullName
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes about projections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they can be thought of as ad-hoc interfaces. They can be applied to any table, but will be a SQL compile error if the proper field names are not present on the table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one can select multiple projections, comma delimited. in this case, common field names between the projections will be repeated… (or should they just be indicated once???)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if projecting a table alias &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, it would be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;select a.&amp;lt;contact_info&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a delimited name is needed, it would be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;select &amp;lt;[projection name]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the above example uses another feature of BQL discussed below, string interpolation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boolean values first class citizens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BQL has &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; as new keywords which translate into a SQL &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bit&lt;/code&gt; data type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the following BQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiles into the following SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any statement contains usage of the boolean values &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, it will be transpiled into a local variable reference which is initialized at &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. This prevents some common ambiguities found between the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;BIT&lt;/code&gt; value of 1 and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/code&gt; value of 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, many expressions are automatically converted into boolean expressions if evaluated in an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; structure or a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: more needs to be discussed on first-class suport of booleans in BQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no need for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SET&lt;/code&gt;… ie, the line &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@a = 1&lt;/code&gt; =&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SET @a = 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Control-flow Logic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BQL introduces the usage of curly brackets as natural scope boundaries, similar to (but not equivalent to) SQL’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;BEGIN ... END&lt;/code&gt; syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brackets as scope boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;BEGIN ... END&lt;/code&gt; we would have brackets. ie,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* boolean expression */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* expression */&lt;/span&gt;
} &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; expression
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Variable declaration simplified…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- implicit type&lt;/span&gt;
var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;abc&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- explicit type&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;MAX&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;abc&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DATETIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better implicit type coercion…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;abc&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// prints &apos;abc123&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;PRINT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;abc&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; CAST&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this should be thought about a little more. I like this, but it could actually cause existing (valid) SQL to break where the original intention different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;C-style &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* expressions */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHILE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BEGIN&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* expressions */&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    }

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* expressions */&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: might want to talk about how this promotes precedural flow in SQL which isn’t necessarily a good thing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;String interpolation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;john doe&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- prints &apos;my name is john doe&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;my name is: {{name}}&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: we could adopt something different than this sort of “mustache-style” here. We might want to think more about this. This is also potentially the most obvious breach of being a “strict superset” of SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local scoping rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  { &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// new variable scope...&lt;/span&gt;
    var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// prints 2&lt;/span&gt;
}

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// prints 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this would compile into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i_two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BEGIN&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i_two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;PRINT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i_two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;PRINT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can also declare local scope by just writing code inside brackets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;{
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- in this scope, @i is an int&lt;/span&gt;
    var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
}
{
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- in this scope, @i is of type varchar&lt;/span&gt;
    var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;abc&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ternary operator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt; ? &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;123&apos;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;456&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;CASE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;THEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;123&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ELSE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;456&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Null coalescing operator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; students
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; name ?? &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;N/A&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; ISNULL&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;N/A&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; students&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boolean operators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* expressions */&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BEGIN&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* expressions */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method notation on various datatypes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;various datatypes would have various “methods” defined for them which simply compile into calls for the global method…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for instance, everything would have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.toString()&lt;/code&gt; method…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos; AbcdEf &apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; GETUTCDATE&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Methods for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nchar&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nvarchar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trim()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ltrim()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rtrim()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toLowerCase()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toUpperCase()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toTitleCase() - not sure this is possible/practical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;padLeft()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;padRight()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pad()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contains(string s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;endsWith(string s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;startsWith(string s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;substring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;split(string seperator) - this would return a table… could be interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toCharSet() - not sure if this is possible/practical, but could be a cool feature as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;indexOf()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;calling methods on variables would work pretty much how you would expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@s.trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;LTRIM&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;RTRIM&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and so on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Methods for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addDays(numerical d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addHours(numerical d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addMinutes(numerical d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addMilliseconds(numerical d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addMonths(numerical d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addSeconds(numerical d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addTicks(numerical d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;addYears(numerical d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toOADate()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toString(string format)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subtract(datetime d) - need to think about this more… how is a timespan represented in SQL?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add(datetime d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dayOfMonth()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dayOfYear()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dayOfWeek()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hour()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minute()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;millisecond()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ticks()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;year()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;date()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note: i’d like to think more about functionality that can be had around UTC time / local time conversion and such. Could be a big win for this language if implemented in a way that prevented people from doing bad practices…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Methods on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tinyint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toString(string format)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Datetime declaration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a convention for declaring date times will exist, but i’m not sure on the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;could be: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var @dt = #1/12/2014#&lt;/code&gt; (this is kind of similar to an MS Access convention).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;could also be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var @dt = &amp;amp;&amp;#39;1/12/2014&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Regular expressions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;o&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;me?reg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;ular&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;ex&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;pression&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;abcd&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@islower&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;A&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;Z&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I’d like to do more thinking here on how we could bring more native support to regular expressions to SQL. This will largely depend on the target (ie, T-SQL, PL/SQL, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Explicit type casting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; CAST&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt; operators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;abc&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;def&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;abc&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;def&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paging syntax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/code&gt; keywords will be used for paging, and will
satisfy all SQL targets appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; tbl
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; a
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for SQL Server 2008 would compile into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WITH&lt;/span&gt; tbl_paged &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
        a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        ROW_NUMBER&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;OVER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ORDER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ASC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; __row_number
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; tbl
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; tbl_paged
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; __row_number &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;BETWEEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versus MySQL where it would simply compile into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; tbl
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;OFFSET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we are also able to use variables or scalar expressions here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; tbl
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; a
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@size&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WITH&lt;/span&gt; tbl_paged &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
        a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        ROW_NUMBER&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;OVER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ORDER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ASC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; __row_number
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; tbl
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; tbl_paged
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; __row_number &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;BETWEEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: the compilation of these keywords would be different depending on the target… different SQL engines have different support for paging already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implicit “result sets” as local variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result set variables can be declared as you would any other query select statement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; tbl1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result set variables have a couple of unique properties that temp tables and table variables do not have…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Coerce a resultset variable into a boolean as a shortcut for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; tbl1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* expressions */&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this will compile into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            a &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            b &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            c &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INSERT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; tbl1
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TOP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;BEGIN&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* expressions */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Get a resultset variable’s number of rows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;calling a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.length&lt;/code&gt; method on a resultset variable is shorthand for getting the total count&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; tbl1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results.length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            a &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            b &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            c &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INSERT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; tbl1
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;COUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in certain cases where a resultset variable can be optimized into a CTE, it will do so. This is the case when the query is referenced in only one statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; tbl1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- here we only use results in *one* statement&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WITH&lt;/span&gt; results &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
        a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        c
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; tbl1
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; results
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note: some of the above examples would also allow and utilize this optimization, but the compiled output shown is that of the more general case (table variables) simply for clarity of what would normally happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other cases, the resultset variable will be created as a table variable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; tbl1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@results.length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resultsets as partial queries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resultset variables can be useful in taking complex queries and compartmentalizing them into digestable parts without sacrificing performance by storing the results into temp tables, or going through the unnecessary overhead of creating a view to be used just once:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;-- notice how no &quot;select&quot; clause is needed here...&lt;/span&gt;
var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@unpaid_cust&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; customers &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;unpaid&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; invoices i
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@unpaid_cust&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;date_sent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; invoices&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;

    c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;unpaid&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this is a smple example, it should be clear how you can take a very complex query with several joins and partialize it into logically separate pieces, letting BQL compile it into one final efficient query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mixins: Inline Functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;simple inline functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@postUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; mixin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;http://my-blog.com/post/{{@id}}/{{slug}}&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
}


&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; post
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@postUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;slug&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;http://my-blog.com/post/&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; CAST&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;id &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;/&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; slug
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; posts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;var &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@isEmail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; mixin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;{
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@email.contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;@&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
}

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; users
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@isEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;email&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; email&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; email
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; users
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; CHARINDEX&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;@&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;email&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Schema scope declaration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can use a schema scope declaration in order to default to certain databases and schema&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt; abc {
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; tbl1
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c
    }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compiles to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    c
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; abc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tbl1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if no schema scope is used, the schema will instead be the database default schema. This is essentially like locally “overriding” the database default schema…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some ideas I haven’t thought through yet…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;support for more complicated aggregate functions? For example a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/code&gt; aggregate function based on the XML expand functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what about boolean logic w/ nulls? could we allow &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;if (field_name = null)&lt;/code&gt; in replacement of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IF (field_name IS NULL)&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have some javascript-like type coersion? For example, could &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;!field_name&lt;/code&gt; be converted to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;field_name is null OR field_name = &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; and similar tests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next steps…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages are complicated things, and I think in order to be successful, must be the product of many minds. I’d like for any and all feedback (or help) on producing this language spec, as well as a parser/compiler for it. If you stumbles upon this article because you have similar wishes for such a language to exist, please consider contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lelandrichardson/BQL&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; where I’ve started work on the parser and grammar. Right now I’m trying out &lt;a href=&quot;http://irony.codeplex.com/&quot;&gt;Irony&lt;/a&gt; to build an AST, as it makes building into the Visual Studio toolchain very easy, but the Irony grammar is very easy to translate into BNF if we want to try other AST Parsers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the very least, share your opinions below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That’s great, and I don’t think it should be any different, but developers need to look out for common use case scenarios where there is often the potential to be a lot of duplicated boiler-plate code. One such case (I have found) is creating paged datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Simple Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I just have an array of simple JS/JSON objects, all I want to do is build a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.computed&lt;/code&gt; computed observable that simply pulls out the slice of the array that represents the current “page”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple. Someone reasonably adept at knockout can knock that out pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with our viewmodel (which in my examples will follow a constructor pattern, however this does not have to be the case):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;ExampleViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// other viewmodel data we don&apos;t care about&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// the array of items that I want to page&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;items &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool. Okay, well I have my viewmodel here… I might as well start slamming some observables related to my pager on there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;ExampleViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// stuff that matters&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ---------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;items &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// pager related stuff&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ---------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;currentPage &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;perPage &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;pagedItems &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;computed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; pg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;currentPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      start &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;perPage &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there ya have it. A pager in Knockout.JS. Wiring it up to the view is somewhat trivial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;pager&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;css: {&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;: !previousPageEnabled()}&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;#&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;click: previousPage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Previous&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a relatively simple result to accomplish with knockout… but if you feel like this is a little bit lacking, you are not alone. The problem is there is just a bunch of logic up there that just shouldn’t matter to us. This is not really business logic… it is a common UI implementation that has nothing to do with the core of our application - so I don’t want to look at it! More than that, I have just added a bunch of properties to my viewmodel which might end up getting serialized to JSON and sent to my server, which I don’t want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more, this is about &lt;em&gt;as simple&lt;/em&gt; as your situation will possibly be. Chances are, you are probably wanting to do something more complicated, like pull data from the server asynchronously via ajax… In this case, these methods are going to get more and more complicated, making our viewModel even more messy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting DRY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevermind loading data via AJAX for a moment. Let’s just get this thing out of our viewmodel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, we are going to extend the prototype of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt;. This feels appropriate, since we are typically going to want to page an array, and our viewModel might have several arrays, each of which need to be paged. This has a slight limitation in that it prevents us from creating a paged array around a plain old JS array (ie, only works on a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt;), but I am okay with that right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we rework our code a bit and come up with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;observableArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;fn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;paged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;perPage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; items &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;current &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;perPage &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; perPage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;pagedItems &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;computed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; pg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      start &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;perPage &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      end &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; start &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;perPage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;start&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; end&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the code here is essentially the same as before. The main difference here is that we are now hanging all of our pager methods off of the actual &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt; instance, instead of our viewModel directly. &lt;strong&gt;Remember, this is possible because an instance of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt; is actually just a function. And functions can have properties just like any other object in JavaScript!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in the functionally equivalent, but a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; cleaner viewmodel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;ExampleViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;items &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the modified HTML:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;pager&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;css: {&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;: !items.prev.enabled()}&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;#&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;click: items.prev&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Previous&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;css: {&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;: !items.next.enabled()}&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;#&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;click: items.next&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Next&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jsfiddle.net/lelandrichardson/BnYMW/&quot;&gt;See jsFiddle Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, we do gain some other benefit of the added abstraction: the benefit of being DRY. For example, we could have multiple paged arrays in the same View Model if we wanted without sharing any state!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;apples &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;oranges &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Handling The More Common Case: Lazy-Loaded paged data-sets via AJAX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paged lists are nothing new. Turns out there is lots of data on the internet, and it often times is not economical or practical to display it to the user all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example above helps us stay DRY, but only helps us in the cases where we have all of the data already on the client. Although this is helpful some of the time, a much more practical scenario is when we have a (potentially) large dataset that is being stored on the server (likely in a database), and we want to display results to the user querying it, but we obviously don’t want the client to have to download all of the data at once!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although the code above is a fun little exercise, it is hard to really say that it is useful. I like useful things, so let’s take another stab at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Being useful: handle any case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we don’t want to just rewrite the above code to work asynchronously, but forget the static case altogether! Let’s provide an API that is flexible enough to let the user (read: developer) decided how he/she wants the pager to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this, I am merely going to provide some of the key snippets. The code here is getting a bit lengthier and the point is lost with boiler-plate logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When loading data asynchronously, you want to minimize trips to the server, so we must store whether or not we have retrieved a certain page or not. To do this, we create a local array called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/code&gt; which is an array of booleans. Thus, to check if the 5th page has been loaded, we simply see if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;loaded[5] === true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; loaded &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// set [0] to true just because.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;goToPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;loaded&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;pg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//data is already loaded. change page asynchronously to simulate a *really fast* ajax call&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// request data from server&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devil might be in the details, but this demonstrates the main mechanics of it all. The key things to note here are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.push&lt;/code&gt; is not used to add items to the array.&lt;br/&gt; This is because &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.push&lt;/code&gt; adds elements to the end of an array. Since we are lazy loading, we may end up loading page 3 before we have page 2. In this scenario we need to add elements to the correct index on the array. It’s kind of messed up that JavaScript arrays let you do this… but that’s another discussion in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even when we have the data, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; is used.&lt;br/&gt;This is a rather important principle when writing code for others to use: &lt;strong&gt;Don’t write methods that are asynchronous or synchronous only part of the time.&lt;/strong&gt; By using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; we are effectively emulating an AJAX call that is just really fast. This allows the user to write code against the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.goToPage()&lt;/code&gt; method in a consistent way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;items.notifySubscribers()&lt;/code&gt; call is required here.&lt;br/&gt; This is because we are using the array &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.splice&lt;/code&gt; method on the underlying array in order to add data to it. Because we are unwrapping the observable to do this (and never calling the setter method, or any of the special &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt; methods), knockout doesn’t know that the array has changed. To let knockout know that the data has changed, we call the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.notifySubscribers()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this works, you may have noticed it only works for asynchronously-loaded datasets, and doesn’t allow for much configuration. Building configurable API’s adds a considerable amount of code, and thus I have removed it above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, however, take the time to build a first-version of a knockout plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lelandrichardson/knockout-paged&quot;&gt;which I have put on github&lt;/a&gt;. It allows for the flexibility that I was calling for above, and used the above code as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this plugin, one calls it in an almost identical fashion to the examples above. The API is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is returned?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.paged&lt;/code&gt; on a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt; instance, the result is the same observable array, augmented with several different paging-related properties which are added to the observableArray itself (not the underlying array).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following properties are added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;current&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Type:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observable(Number)&lt;/code&gt; ) &lt;br/&gt; An observable of the current page number (starting from 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pagedItems&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Type:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt; ) &lt;br/&gt; An observable array containing only the items of the current page. (ie, the “paged items”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pageSize&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Type:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; ) &lt;br/&gt; The integer value of the page size (default is 10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isLoading&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Type:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observable(Boolean)&lt;/code&gt; ) &lt;br/&gt; An observable indicating whether or not data is currently being retrieved from the server (only ever true for Ajaxified datasets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; (method) &lt;br/&gt; If enabled, loads the next page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/code&gt; (method) &lt;br/&gt; If enabled, loads the previous page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;goToPage&lt;/code&gt; (method(&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;)) &lt;br/&gt; Goes to the designated page. (Indexed starting at 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paged observable array can be created by using one of the three different method signatures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Page locally available data easily&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;// data is already loaded on the client
.paged(Number pageSize) =&amp;gt; ko.observableArray (self)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pageSize&lt;/code&gt; : A &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; (Integer expected) indicating the desired page size for the observable array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;returns&lt;/strong&gt; : The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt; instance that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.paged&lt;/code&gt; was called on, augmented with the paging methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;ExampleViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;apples &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//... data can be loaded at any time&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;apples&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; type&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Jazz&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Ripe&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Page server-side dataset with Url Template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// data is to be loaded via ajax, with a regular URL structure&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Number pageSize&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; String templateUrl&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pageSize&lt;/code&gt; : A &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; (Integer expected) indicating the desired page size for the observable array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;templateUrl&lt;/code&gt; : A &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; representing the URL template to be used to grab the data from the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;returns&lt;/strong&gt; : The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ko.observableArray&lt;/code&gt; instance that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.paged&lt;/code&gt; was called on, augmented with the paging methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// apples is empty. will automatically load first page, and any other page which is requested&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// by using the provided url template&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;apples &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/url/to/get/apples?page={page}&amp;amp;pageSize={pageSize}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configure it to do what you need with options hash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Object config&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case we simply pass in an object hash with whatever options we want to set. The following options are made available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-bordered&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;pageSize&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The desired page size. Expected to be an integer&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            Whether or not the dataset will be loaded asynchronously or not.  
            Note: this may be overridden if async-only options are provided when this is set to 
            false or vice-versa.
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            A string template for a URL optionally containing any of the following formatters: &lt;code&gt;{page}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{pageSize}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{start}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{end}&lt;/code&gt; which will then be replaced with the corresponding data.  For example, &lt;code&gt;&apos;/resource/list/start/{start}/end/{end}&apos;&lt;/code&gt; will produce &lt;code&gt;&apos;/resource/list/start/0/end/10&apos;&lt;/code&gt; on initialization with default options. &lt;b&gt;Note: async only&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            A function which will be expected to receive a single parameter which is an object hash containing the properties &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pageSize&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;, and return the to be requested to get the corresponding page of data. &lt;b&gt;Note: async only&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;cache&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
Boolean representing whether or not the data retrieved from the server should be reused the next time the page is requested.  Default is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note: async only&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;mapFromServer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
A callback function which is called on AJAX success with the AJAX response as the only parameter.  The callback is expected to return the array to be the current page. &lt;b&gt;Note: async only&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;ctor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            A constructor function which will be mapped to the data being pulled from the server. &lt;b&gt;Note: async only&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;ajaxOptions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
An options hash to be passed into the jQuery &lt;code&gt;$.ajax&lt;/code&gt; method when a page is requested asynchronously. &lt;b&gt;Note: async only&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it in action in this fiddle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:100%;height:320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://jsfiddle.net/lelandrichardson/r9f2r/embedded/result,js,html&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunately, the source had to be hacked a little bit in order to work with jsFiddle&apos;s JSON echo API, but it demonstrates the asynchronous nature of the pager that can be achieved.  If I get a bit further with this project, I will provide some more complete examples and update this article.
&lt;h2&gt;Future Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is a plugin that I believe I myself will use, I would like to keep improving on it. I am open to suggestions on the best way to do that. If you have opinions on how this API should change or be improved, please share! (or submit a pull request).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the source available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lelandrichardson/knockout-paged&quot;&gt;GitHub: lelandrichardson/knockout-paged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My major plans for it right now (other than fixing bugs and making it more robust) is to add support for RESTful endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts is this could go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// instead of providing a url template, you would simply provide the resource name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// and it would do the rest of the work&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;apples &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ko&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observableArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;paged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    pageSize&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    resource&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESTful API’s have an entirely different way of handling paged datasets, which is by sending back one or more “next”, “prev”, “first”, and “last” URLs along with the response. I intend on adding handling of this by default soon, and I think this could result in a very clean API. I am certainly open to suggestions here as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lukemapper: A Super Fast ORM for Lucene.net]]></title><description><![CDATA[Lucene is a document storage search engine library that utilizes inverted indexes and has great capabilities.

It has been very popular and has been ported to almost every language, including .Net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Lucene.Net for search here at Tech.Pro. Lucene has incredibly useful features, but it is built to work solely with strings, which can be a strong disadvantage if one is trying to store data of other types in a document. In addition, translating documents to strongly typed objects can be an annoying and redundant task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also use Dapper.Net here at Tech.Pro, and we love it’s simple API and extremely satisfactory performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept I am trying to achieve is something similar in spirit to &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/&quot;&gt;Dapper&lt;/a&gt;, except is meant to deal with mapping Lucene Documents to generic Objects, rather than Rows from a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Lucene is schema-less, in practice there is often an implicit schema in a Document which corresponds to a class or object in your code-base. Although you can easily use ORMs like Dapper or EntityFramework to map data from an RDBMS to CLR objects, doing so in Lucene is cumbersome and error-prone. Enter LukeMapper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desired API is something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given some generic class in .Net like as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;PocoClass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; Id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; Name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; PropId &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; PropName &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to run a query against an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IndexSearcher&lt;/code&gt; in Lucene, and return the corresponding documents
mapped to a List&lt;PocoClass&gt;, I could do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;IndexSearcher&lt;/span&gt; searcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt; qry&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; numberToReturn &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

List&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;PocoClass&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; results &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; searcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token generic-method&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;PocoClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;qry&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; numberToReturn&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.Query&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(Query,int)&lt;/code&gt; method is implemented as an extension method to an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IndexSearcher&lt;/code&gt;, similar to
how Dapper’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.Query&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; method is implemented as an extension method to an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IDBConnection&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, for Write operations, I would do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;IndexWriter&lt;/span&gt; writer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
IEnumerable&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;PocoClass&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; objects&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// insert objects into index&lt;/span&gt;
writer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;objects&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And similarly, an update operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;IndexWriter&lt;/span&gt; writer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
IEnumerable&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;PocoClass&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; objects&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//method to find the corresponding document to update&lt;/span&gt;
Func&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;PocoClass&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Query&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; identifyingQuery &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; o &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TermQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Term&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;o&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ToString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// update objects in index&lt;/span&gt;
writer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;objects&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; identifyingQuery&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to Dapper and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sapiens/SqlFu&quot;&gt;other Micro-ORMs out there&lt;/a&gt;, the implementation of the &lt;strong&gt;mapping will be done by generating a Deserializer/Serializer method via IL-Generation and caching it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.Query()&lt;/code&gt; operation, the desired IL method generated should be semantically similar to the IL generated from the following method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;PocoClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ExampleDeserializerMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Document&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; poco &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;PocoClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    poco&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Convert&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ToInt32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    poco&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    poco&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;PropId &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Convert&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ToInt32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;PropId&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    poco&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;PropName &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;PropName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; poco&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.Write()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Update()&lt;/code&gt; methods, the Serializer methods will be semantically similar to the IL generated from the following method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Document&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ExampleSerializerMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;PocoClass&lt;/span&gt; obj&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; doc &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    doc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; obj&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ToString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Field&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Store&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;YES&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Field&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    doc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; obj&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Field&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Store&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;YES&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Field&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    doc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;PropId&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; obj&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;PropId&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ToString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Field&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Store&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;YES&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Field&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    doc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;PropName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; obj&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;PropName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Field&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Store&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;YES&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Field&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; doc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, some error handling may need to be inserted, among other things to make the method a bit more robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enhancing / Customizing with Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although basic functionality works essentially out of the box, with no attributes needed, further flexibility is garnered by the use of various Attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;LukeMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;IgnoreByDefault &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ExampleClass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// doesn&apos;t get indexed/stored&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Luke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Store &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Store&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;YES&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; Id &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Custom Serialization/Deserialization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can override the serialization of certain properties, even more complex ones which are not supported, if it is needed for your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a common example might be that I have a list or array of something that I would like to serialize/deserialize into the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can simply specify a static method to use for the serialization (and deserialization) using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;LukeSerializerAttribute&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;LukeDeserializerAttribute&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TestCustomSerializerClass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//this list would typically be ignored&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; List&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; CustomList &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, the cacheing is done via a hashcode which should be unique to the declared fields in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IndexSearcher&lt;/code&gt;’s index,
and the object type which it is being mapped to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Types supported:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;DateTime?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Progress (Not Yet Supported):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;char?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;byte?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an example class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TestClass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; Id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; PropString &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test was to instantiate 500 instances of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TestClass&lt;/code&gt;, and compared inserting the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-bordered&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Operation&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;LukeMapper&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Lucene.Net (native)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Insert 500 Documents (With no Serializer Cached)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;89ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;19ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Insert 500 Documents (Subsequent Calls)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3.31ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4.52ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Query 500 Documents (With no Deserializer Cached)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;49ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Query 500 Documents (Subsequent Calls)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1.26ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1.05ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a simple class, with only a string and an int, so I ran a second test with 2 more properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TestClass1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; Id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; PropString &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt; DateTime &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; NullId &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which had the following similar performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-bordered&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Operation&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;LukeMapper&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Lucene.Net (native)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Insert 500 Documents (With no Serializer Cached)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;103ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;23ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Insert 500 Documents (Subsequent Calls)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5.84ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;6.05ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Query 500 Documents (With no Deserializer Cached)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;42ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Query 500 Documents (Subsequent Calls)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1.84ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1.15ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these benchmarks show is essentially what is to be expected. The first time &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.Write()&lt;/code&gt; is called on a class, it takes O(10^2) ms to generate the deserializer/serializer method. Once it is cached, the write and read operations are of the same order as the native calls (which they should be, since we are generating essentially the same CIL as when we are hand-coding it). What is a bit mysterious to me is why LukeMapper seems to consistently be writing to the index faster. This may be an issue with the benchmark. You can find the actual code used to find these numbers &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lelandrichardson/LukeMapper/blob/master/LukeMapper.Benchmarks/Program.cs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone would like me to compare it to anything else, let me know. As far as I know there aren’t really any other ORMs for lucene out there to compare against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pseudo-Code: Under The Hood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code of LukeMapper is essentially a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lelandrichardson/LukeMapper/blob/master/LukeMapper.cs&quot;&gt;single file&lt;/a&gt; which exposes several extension methods to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IndexWriter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IndexSearcher&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.Query()&lt;/code&gt; method might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; IEnumerable&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token generic-method&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;IndexSearcher&lt;/span&gt; searcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt; query&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/*, Sort sort*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// run actual search&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TopDocs&lt;/span&gt; td &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; searcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;query&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; n&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// if no results, nothing to do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;td&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;TotalHits &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//check to see if we have a deserializer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; deserializer &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Cache&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;searcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;deserializer &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// need to generate deserializer&lt;/span&gt;
        deserializer &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;GenerateDeserializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;searcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//perform mapping&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; document &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; td&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ScoreDocs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sd&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;searcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sd&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;doc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; next&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        next &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;deserializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;next&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the magic is essentially in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;GenerateDeserializer&lt;/code&gt; method. This is where reflection is used to determine what IL to generate and cache as a method. In some seriously simplified pseudo-code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; Func&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;GenerateDeserializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt; type&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;IndexSearcher&lt;/span&gt; searcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; dm &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;DynamicMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; il &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dm&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;GetILGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; properties &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;GetSettableProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;type&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; fields &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;GetSettableFields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;type&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; attributes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;GetLukeAttributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;type&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; prop &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; properties&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// figure out prop type, attributes, etc. and emit proper IL.&lt;/span&gt;
        il&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        il&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; field &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; fields&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// figure out prop type, attributes, etc. and emit proper IL.&lt;/span&gt;
        il&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        il&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        il&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Func&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;dm&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;CreateDelegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Func&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods for generating serializer methods are very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the code, you can see it all on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lelandrichardson/LukeMapper&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways this is not as practical as Dapper and is more of a specific application; Lucene is only meant to handle textual data and is schema-less, so mapping to objects of non-textual type with a specific schema is more error prone. The reality, though, is that most Lucene indexes are implemented with a relatively uniform schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Current Status&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started working on this project more and think it has promise and will likely use it in some projects of my own. If anyone is interested in helping out, I would certainly love the help. On the other hand, if anyone has any suggestions or feature requests, bring them on. Although this is not currently used in the Tech.Pro codebase, it will be soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I am focusing on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the error handling / feedback currently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build in some support for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;NumericField&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attribute to specify the “Identifier” of an object, and auto-generate the “identifyingQuery” needed for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Update()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attribute to utilize term vectors usefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build in some automatic support for handling lists in typical fashion (ie csv, json-encoding, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;’s and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;’s working (seriously, why are they so difficult?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would like to get the project hosted on NuGet. Need to look into this as I have never done it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lelandrichardson/LukeMapper&quot;&gt;LukeMapper GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any and all comments/feedback appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Tricks to get More out of SQL Server in Common Web Scenarios]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn several little-known SQL tricks/techniques used to improve query times and enforce business rules with common everyday web-development…]]></description><link>intelligiblebabble.com/3-tricks-to-get-more-out-of-sql-server-in-common-web-scenarios/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">intelligiblebabble.com/3-tricks-to-get-more-out-of-sql-server-in-common-web-scenarios/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learn several little-known SQL tricks/techniques used to improve query times and enforce business rules with common everyday web-development scenarios&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Article Index:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MERGE Statement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indexed Views (a.k.a Materialized Views)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common Table Expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The MERGE Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb510625.aspx&quot;&gt;Merge Statement&lt;/a&gt; is a small treasure made available in SQL Server 2008. It can be used in many different scenarios, but I find it constantly useful in simplifying some CRUD-type logic in Web Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the MERGE Statement takes two tables, one being the &lt;strong&gt;SOURCE&lt;/strong&gt; table and the other being the &lt;strong&gt;TARGET&lt;/strong&gt; table, and attempts to perform a join based on some criteria. In most cases this will be a common identity or key column just as it would be in a normal SQL JOIN. Using these two tables, it allows you to specify several different actions to perform for different scenarios. The canonical use of this, which may be clear from the name of the statement, is to take two tables which hold essentially the same information, and MERGE them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a member table defined like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Member](
	[ID] int,
	[Email] varchar(127),
	[FullName] varchar(127),
	[IsSubscribed] bit
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you might have a separate table called “Subscriber” which holds a subscriber email list for your product. Now, traditionally it would make more sense for you to just have one table, since we have both an email field and an “IsSubscribed” flag to indicate that they should get your email, but your subscriber table might be from some third party tool and so you might need to perform some synchronization. This is exactly the scenario MERGE was intended for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with our Subscriber table which might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Subscriber](
	[Email] varchar(127),
	[FullName] varchar(127),
	[DateSubscribed] datetime
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now synchronize these two tables using MERGE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;MERGE dbo.Member as TARGET
USING dbo.Subscriber as SOURCE
ON ( TARGET.Email = SOURCE.Email )
WHEN MATCHED THEN
	-- SOURCE has matching email in TARGET
	-- UPDATE TARGET to indicate its a subscriber
	UPDATE SET TARGET.[IsSubscribed] = ((1))

WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
	-- SOURCE has row with no match in TARGET
	-- INSERT missing subscriber into TARGET
	INSERT (Email, FullName, IsSubscribed)
	VALUES (SOURCE.Email, SOURCE.FullName, ((1)));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are often called “Delta Operations” when you are trying to determine the differences on two tables based off some common key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enforce voting system business logic efficiently with MERGE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great, but truth be told this scenario doesn’t come up ALL that often. I end up using the MERGE statement in a bit of a different way so let me walk you through how it has been useful for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a web application where a heavy amount of voting is performed on some entity. You have the following business rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an Entity can be voted up or down with amount +1 or -1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a user is allowed to cast one vote per entity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given we have the two tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Entity](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	-- More Entity specific fields
)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[EntityVote](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[VoterId] [int] NOT NULL,
	[EntityId] [int] NOT NULL,
	[Direction] [int] NOT NULL
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would like to have a web page with some up-vote and down-vote button which votes via AJAX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you want to make sure that your business rules are enforced at the database level (or at least server-side) so that user’s can’t register false votes for a given entity (each user can only vote once!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quick approach which is sure to work is to create a UNIQUE INDEX on the EntityVote table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IX_Entity_Vote_SingleVote]
ON [dbo].[EntityVote]
(
	[EntityId] ASC,
	[VoterId] ASC
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will enforce your business rules, and prevent users from “hacking” the system. This is less than ideal, however, as every time a user tries to insert a vote again this will raise an error on SQL Server and will cause unnecessary overhead since it is not being handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to circumvent this, you may then decide to build a more robust Stored Procedure to handle this logic when working with a vote. Us developers may want to write this stored procedure like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[spu_Entity_Vote_Insert](
	@VoterId int,
	@EntityId int,
	@Direction int
)
AS
BEGIN
	SET NOCOUNT ON;


	IF EXISTS(
		SELECT TOP 1
			Id
		FROM dbo.EntityVote
		WHERE VoterId = @VoterId
		AND EntityId = @EntityId
		AND Direction = @Direction)
	BEGIN
		--same vote exists -&amp;gt; user is &amp;quot;un-voting&amp;quot;
		DELETE FROM dbo.EntityVote
		WHERE VoterId = @VoterId
		AND EntityId = @EntityId
		AND Direction = @Direction
	END
	ELSE IF EXISTS(
		SELECT TOP 1
			Id
		FROM dbo.EntityVote
		WHERE VoterId = @VoterId
		AND EntityId = @EntityId
		AND Direction &amp;lt;&amp;gt; @Direction)
	BEGIN
		--same voter/entity exists, but different amount
		--this means user is changing his mind.
		UPDATE dbo.EntityVote
			SET Direction = @Direction
		WHERE VoterId = @VoterId
		AND EntityId = @EntityId
		AND Direction &amp;lt;&amp;gt; @Direction
	END
	ELSE
	BEGIN
		--new voter/entity combo, insert vote
		INSERT INTO dbo.EntityVote(
			VoterId,
			EntityId,
			Direction
		) VALUES (
			@VoterId,
			@EntityId,
			@Direction
		)
	END
END&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoid Race Conditions in “UPSERT”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the DBA’s reading this might be thinking after looking at a stored procedure like that is that you have just introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/dang/archive/2007/10/28/Conditional-INSERTUPDATE-Race-Condition.aspx&quot;&gt;Race Condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race Conditions stem from the fact that us simple-minded developers often times write SQL (and code in general) under the false assumption that this code is only ever going to be run synchronously, and that these IF/ELSE Logic loops will always return the same result within the context of the procedure. Since SQL Server can hold MANY connections at once, any of which can be executing this stored procedure, we could have a situation where this is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are MySQL devs, you might be familiar with the INSERT .. ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE … syntax, which I was always jealous of after moving to SQL Server (this was before I knew about the MERGE syntax…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, one way to prevent this, as mentioned in the article above, is to simply demand that all of this be executed as a single transaction. This can be done with the &lt;strong&gt;BEGIN TRAN&lt;/strong&gt; statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[spu_Entity_Vote_Insert](
	@VoterId int,
	@EntityId int,
	@Direction int
)
AS
BEGIN
	SET NOCOUNT, XACT_ABORT ON

	BEGIN TRAN

	-- original stored procedure code

	COMMIT
END&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you guys, but this starts to worry me a little bit. Seems like there is a lot going on there for one transaction, and I don’t like to use the BEGIN TRAN / COMMIT statements loosely. Here is where the MERGE statement can help us. The MERGE statement is actually built for all of this “UPSERT” type madness and is run off of a a single join + scan, and thus a single transaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[spu_Entity_Vote_Insert](
	@VoterId int,
	@EntityId int,
	@Direction int
)
AS
BEGIN
	SET NOCOUNT ON;

	MERGE dbo.EntityVote as TARGET
	USING ( SELECT
		@VoterId as VoterId,
		@EntityId as EntityId,
		@Direction as Direction
	) as SOURCE
	ON (
		SOURCE.EntityId = TARGET.EntityId
		AND
		SOURCE.VoterId = TARGET.VoterId
	)
	--same vote exists -&amp;gt; user is &amp;quot;un-voting&amp;quot;
	WHEN MATCHED AND (SOURCE.Direction = TARGET.Direction)
		THEN DELETE

	--same voter/entity exists, but different amount
	--this means user is changing his mind.
	WHEN MATCHED AND (SOURCE.Direction &amp;lt;&amp;gt; TARGET.Direction)
		THEN UPDATE
			SET TARGET.Direction = SOURCE.Direction

	--new voter/entity combo, insert vote
	WHEN NOT MATCHED
		THEN INSERT (
			VoterId,
			EntityId,
			Direction
		) VALUES (
			SOURCE.VoterId,
			SOURCE.EntityId,
			SOURCE.Direction
		)
	;
END&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement will find out if the record exists, and then operate on it appropriately - allowing us to expand the logic if necessary. While at first this may be slightly less readable, once you get familiar with the syntax it is actually much better in my opinion. Plus, we don’t have to get into any of that nasty BEGIN TRAN / COMMIT stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Indexed Views (a.k.a Materialized Views)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware, there is no MySQL equivalent to the SQL Server Indexed Views. While most developer-facing differences between the two database engines comes down to semantics, I actually consider this to be a fairly large win for MS SQL. While they can certainly be overused, if you have relationships across large tables that are being utilized on a regular basis in the form of a READ, and the tables are not too INSERT heavy, &lt;strong&gt;indexed views can be a tremendous win.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came in quite handy for me a couple of weeks ago in a situation which I think is quite common: a web application where some Entity has comments. Comments are usually associated with an application User, which is also another table. So that makes an Entity table, Comments table, and User (“Member”) table:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Entity](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	-- More Entity specific fields
)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Member](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[FullName] varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	-- More member-related specific fields
)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[EntityComment](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[MemberId] [int] NOT NULL,
	[EntityId] [int] NOT NULL,
	[CommentBody] varchar(MAX) NOT NULL,
	[DateCreated] datetime NOT NULL
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, wait. Let’s make it even better. Let’s say we have multiple entities, each of which have comments… so being the nice relational DBA’s that we are, we decide that ALL comments for ALL entities will reside in one table, and we will just create a Cross Reference table for each entity. So now we have this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Entity](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	-- More Entity specific fields
)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Member](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[FullName] varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	-- More member-related specific fields
)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[EntityToComment](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[CommentId] [int] NOT NULL,
	[EntityId] [int] NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Comment](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[MemberId] [int] NOT NULL,
	[CommentBody] varchar(MAX) NOT NULL,
	[DateCreated] datetime NOT NULL
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in a typical scenario we might have a web-page which is viewing an Entity based off of the primary key… ie, some endpoint like: &lt;strong&gt;www.example.com/entity/detail/123&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, here we write a nice little query to pull all of the data for the entity with a simple primary key lookup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SELECT *
FROM dbo.Entity
WHERE Id = @Id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done. Now we want the comments… and things get a little bit messier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SELECT
	c.*,
	m.*
FROM dbo.EntityToComment as ec
INNER JOIN dbo.Comment as c
ON c.Id = ec.CommentId
INNER JOIN dbo.Member as m
ON m.Id = c.MemberId
WHERE ec.EntityId = @Id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. Great. Looks like we are done! We now have all of the information we need to display comments on the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is true, let’s say your site makes it big and your Comments table all of a sudden gets to be a couple of million rows long. More than that, maybe your member table and entity tables are similarly of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;O(10^6)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;For a high traffic site, this is not going to cut it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you would want to do is to create an index on dbo.Comment over the MemberId column. Similarly, you could create an index across the dbo.EntityToComment for the EntityId, CommentId columns. This will definitely be faster, but you know what can be EVEN FASTER? &lt;strong&gt;Indexed views&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to use indexed views one first must create a Schema Bound view like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE VIEW [dbo].[vu_Entity_Comment_Member]
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
SELECT
	c.Id,
	c.CommentBody,
	c.DateCreated,
	c.MemberId,
	m.FullName,
	-- more Comment or Member fields, if needed
FROM dbo.EntityToComment as ec
INNER JOIN dbo.Comment as c
ON c.Id = ec.CommentId
INNER JOIN dbo.Member as m
ON m.Id = c.MemberId&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the &lt;strong&gt;WITH SCHEMABINDING&lt;/strong&gt; keyword here. This is important, and SQL Server will yell at you if you try to create an index on a table which is not Schema Bound. This essentially means that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187956.aspx&quot;&gt;view has constraints such that the referenced tables can not be altered in a way that would make the view invalid&lt;/a&gt;. If you ask me, this should be a default value for SQL Views - but that’s another discussion. In any event, &lt;strong&gt;if you use views in SQL Server, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to use the SCHEMABINDING keyword all of the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we actually want to create a non-clustered index on the view in question. A lot of people find indexes to be these mystical creatures that can never be tamed or tricked into showing up in our execution plans, but BTREE-like indexes AREN’T THAT HARD to understand if you &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree&quot;&gt;sit down and actually think about what they are&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa174537%28v=sql.80%29.aspx&quot;&gt;how they work&lt;/a&gt;. For now I will take the easy route out and say that is outside the scope of this post, but I strongly encourage reading the links above if you don’t think you could explain an index to a 10 year old… your users will thank you.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index we want on our view is one which has EntityId’s as primary nodes, since that is what we will be passing in the WHERE clause in our web page’s stored procedure. The EntityId is not unique on this view (ie, there will be multiple rows returned per EntityId) and thus we will need to create a UNIQUE index first, then the Non-clustered index:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX [IX_vu_Entity_Comment_Member_Unique]
ON [dbo].[vu_Entity_Comment_Member]
([ID] ASC)

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_EntityId_vu_Question_Comment_Member
ON [dbo].[vu_Entity_Comment_Member] (EntityId)
INCLUDE (Id,
	CommentBody,
	DateCreated,
	MemberId,
	FullName,
	-- more columns from the view, if needed
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that in the Non-Clustered view you will want to INCLUDE every row that you need to push onto the Client through our stored procedure. By including all of these columns, SQL Server is able to avoid a Table Scan in the query, and simply pull the page out of the in-memory index. &lt;strong&gt;This is where our performance gain is&lt;/strong&gt;. Our previous 2 inner joins which required a ton of computation have essentially been reduced to a single memory lookup operation that will complete in unit time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we go back to our stored procedure for our Entity’s detail view with comments and we rewrite our query to use the view instead of the joins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SELECT
	Id,
	CommentBody,
	DateCreated,
	MemberId,
	FullName,
	-- more columns, if needed
FROM [dbo].[vu_Entity_Comment_Member]
WITH (NOEXPAND)
WHERE EntityId = @Id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to notice the query hint &lt;strong&gt;WITH (NOEXPAND)&lt;/strong&gt; added. As far as I know, this simply tells SQL Server that you would like it to treat the view as a TABLE, and not to scan the underlying tables if it doesn’t need to. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://sladescross.wordpress.com/2010/09/26/sql-noexpand-and-indexed-views/&quot;&gt;find out more about NOEXPAND and Indexed Views here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, this stored procedure will be blazing fast, &lt;strong&gt;even with millions and millions of rows in the corresponding tables&lt;/strong&gt;. I chose this example as I think it is a fairly common web-based scenario, as the title suggests, but any developer working in SQL should think about indexed views when constantly hitting tables with multiple joins.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Table Indexes are tremendously helpful for searching across single tables from non-primary keys, but Indexed views can essentially give us the speed of denormalization without needing to worry about synchronizing the denormalized and normalized data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, &lt;strong&gt;page load times are important, and Indexed Views can be a valuable tool to improve them&lt;/strong&gt;. You can see a &lt;a href=&quot;http://samsaffron.com/archive/2011/05/02/A+day+in+the+life+of+a+slow+page+at+Stack+Overflow&quot;&gt;similar use of indexes to improve page performance of stack overflow over at Sam Saffron’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Common Table Expressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190766%28v=sql.105%29.aspx&quot;&gt;Common Table Expressions&lt;/a&gt; are another example of a great tool that I discovered moving from MySQL to SQL Server. As far as I know, you can’t do quite everything you can do with CTE in MySQL (but I welcome someone to show me that this is incorrect)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, CTE is essentially a way to reduce the complexity of complex queries by aliasing them. Here is a simple use case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;WITH CustomerPurchase(
	ProductId,
	CustomerId,
	CustomerName,
	Amount
) AS (
	SELECT
		p.Id,
		c.Id,
		c.CustomerName,
		p.Amount
	FROM Purchase as p
	INNER JOIN Customer as c
	ON p.CustomerId = c.Id
)
SELECT *
FROM CustomerPurchase
WHERE ProductId = @ProductId&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is cool, but doesn’t really help us all that much outside readability and maintainability (and in this case doesn’t even do much there… but I promise, sometimes it is more readable/maintainable)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use Common Table Expressions to implement Paging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, CTE allows us to define calculated columns in our table and then filter them later, which provides us a bigger win. In the case of SQL Server’s built-in RANK functions, this is actually not possible to do without the use of a sub-query. &lt;strong&gt;For example, we can implement PAGING on a table very easily like so&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;WITH Activity  AS
(
	SELECT [ID]
	  -- more columns related to Entity
	  ,[LastActivityDate]
	  ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER
                (ORDER BY [LastActivityDate] DESC) AS RowNumber
	FROM [dbo].[Entity]
)
SELECT *
FROM Activity
WHERE RowNumber
      BETWEEN (@pageNumber - 1) * @perPage + 1
      AND @pageNumber * @perPage
ORDER BY RowNumber ASC;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paging is incredibly important in web-development and should be implemented whenever possible to reduce the number of bytes sent across the wire that are never even seen. Implementing Paging this way should be properly fast provided whatever you have in your OVER() clause is properly indexed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is honestly the most valuable thing I have found for Common Table Expressions other than improving readability, but there are some additional compelling uses in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/83654/Inside-Recursive-CTEs&quot;&gt;ability to use CTEs recursively&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Author’s Note:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL is one of those things that I just tend to learn new things about constantly. While I consider myself a fairly competent SQL developer, I am by no means a DBA. I am sure in a years time I will know much more than I know now, just as now I know far more than I did a year ago, today. This article is meant to educate those who do not know of these features as I did not at one time. Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;please let me know if you found the article useful&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if those links don’t help you, and you are still wanting to learn more, send me an email or a comment and I can point you to some great free online courses discussing indexes in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential Argument: One might say that a comment table is not a good example of an entity which has few reads… I would beg to differ. In the world of the internet, almost EVERY entity will be a “high-read” entity, with the exception of a logging table where inserts will be proportional to the overall number of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: while this is great, one should also weigh the pros and cons between the decrease in read time and the increase in insert time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: when I say “can’t do”, what I really mean is “can’t do without the use of temporary tables or sub-queries”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
